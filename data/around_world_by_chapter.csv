Chapter 2,CHAPTER II.
Chapter 2,IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT IS CONVINCED THAT HE HAS AT LAST FOUND HIS IDEAL
Chapter 2,"“Faith,” muttered Passepartout, somewhat flurried, “I’ve seen people at"
Chapter 2,Madame Tussaud’s as lively as my new master!”
Chapter 2,"Madame Tussaud’s “people,” let it be said, are of wax, and are much"
Chapter 2,visited in London; speech is all that is wanting to make them human.
Chapter 2,"During his brief interview with Mr. Fogg, Passepartout had been"
Chapter 2,carefully observing him. He appeared to be a man about forty years of
Chapter 2,"age, with fine, handsome features, and a tall, well-shaped figure; his"
Chapter 2,"hair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact and unwrinkled, his"
Chapter 2,"face rather pale, his teeth magnificent. His countenance possessed in"
Chapter 2,"the highest degree what physiognomists call “repose in action,” a"
Chapter 2,"quality of those who act rather than talk. Calm and phlegmatic, with a"
Chapter 2,"clear eye, Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure"
Chapter 2,which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas. Seen
Chapter 2,"in the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being"
Chapter 2,"perfectly well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer."
Chapter 2,"Phileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed"
Chapter 2,"even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, as well"
Chapter 2,"as in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions."
Chapter 2,"He was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready, and was"
Chapter 2,economical alike of his steps and his motions. He never took one step
Chapter 2,"too many, and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he"
Chapter 2,"made no superfluous gestures, and was never seen to be moved or"
Chapter 2,"agitated. He was the most deliberate person in the world, yet always"
Chapter 2,reached his destination at the exact moment.
Chapter 2,"He lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation; and"
Chapter 2,"as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction, and"
Chapter 2,"that friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody."
Chapter 2,"As for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris. Since he had"
Chapter 2,"abandoned his own country for England, taking service as a valet, he"
Chapter 2,had in vain searched for a master after his own heart. Passepartout was
Chapter 2,by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Molière with a bold
Chapter 2,"gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow, with a"
Chapter 2,"pleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and serviceable,"
Chapter 2,"with a good round head, such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a"
Chapter 2,"friend. His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund, his figure almost"
Chapter 2,"portly and well-built, his body muscular, and his physical powers fully"
Chapter 2,developed by the exercises of his younger days. His brown hair was
Chapter 2,"somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors are said to have"
Chapter 2,"known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva’s tresses, Passepartout was"
Chapter 2,familiar with but one of dressing his own: three strokes of a
Chapter 2,large-tooth comb completed his toilet.
Chapter 2,It would be rash to predict how Passepartout’s lively nature would
Chapter 2,agree with Mr. Fogg. It was impossible to tell whether the new servant
Chapter 2,would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required;
Chapter 2,experience alone could solve the question. Passepartout had been a sort
Chapter 2,"of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned for repose; but so far"
Chapter 2,"he had failed to find it, though he had already served in ten English"
Chapter 2,"houses. But he could not take root in any of these; with chagrin, he"
Chapter 2,"found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular, constantly"
Chapter 2,"running about the country, or on the look-out for adventure. His last"
Chapter 2,"master, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament, after passing his"
Chapter 2,"nights in the Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home in the"
Chapter 2,"morning on policemen’s shoulders. Passepartout, desirous of respecting"
Chapter 2,"the gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance on such"
Chapter 2,"conduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave. Hearing that Mr."
Chapter 2,"Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was one of"
Chapter 2,"unbroken regularity, that he neither travelled nor stayed from home"
Chapter 2,"overnight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was after. He"
Chapter 2,"presented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen."
Chapter 2,"At half-past eleven, then, Passepartout found himself alone in the"
Chapter 2,"house in Saville Row. He began its inspection without delay, scouring"
Chapter 2,"it from cellar to garret. So clean, well-arranged, solemn a mansion"
Chapter 2,"pleased him; it seemed to him like a snail’s shell, lighted and warmed"
Chapter 2,"by gas, which sufficed for both these purposes. When Passepartout"
Chapter 2,reached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to
Chapter 2,"inhabit, and he was well satisfied with it. Electric bells and"
Chapter 2,speaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories; while on
Chapter 2,"the mantel stood an electric clock, precisely like that in Mr. Fogg’s"
Chapter 2,"bedchamber, both beating the same second at the same instant. “That’s"
Chapter 2,"good, that’ll do,” said Passepartout to himself."
Chapter 2,"He suddenly observed, hung over the clock, a card which, upon"
Chapter 2,"inspection, proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house."
Chapter 2,"It comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the"
Chapter 2,"morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past"
Chapter 2,"eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club—all the details of"
Chapter 2,"service, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight, the"
Chapter 2,"shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, and the toilet at"
Chapter 2,twenty minutes before ten. Everything was regulated and foreseen that
Chapter 2,"was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight, the hour at"
Chapter 2,which the methodical gentleman retired.
Chapter 2,Mr. Fogg’s wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste. Each pair
Chapter 2,"of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of year"
Chapter 2,and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and
Chapter 2,"the same system was applied to the master’s shoes. In short, the house"
Chapter 2,"in Saville Row, which must have been a very temple of disorder and"
Chapter 2,"unrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan, was cosiness,"
Chapter 2,"comfort, and method idealised. There was no study, nor were there"
Chapter 2,"books, which would have been quite useless to Mr. Fogg; for at the"
Chapter 2,"Reform two libraries, one of general literature and the other of law"
Chapter 2,"and politics, were at his service. A moderate-sized safe stood in his"
Chapter 2,"bedroom, constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but"
Chapter 2,Passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere;
Chapter 2,everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits.
Chapter 2,"Having scrutinised the house from top to bottom, he rubbed his hands, a"
Chapter 2,"broad smile overspread his features, and he said joyfully, “This is"
Chapter 2,"just what I wanted! Ah, we shall get on together, Mr. Fogg and I! What"
Chapter 2,"a domestic and regular gentleman! A real machine; well, I don’t mind"
Chapter 2,serving a machine.”
Chapter 3,CHAPTER III.
Chapter 3,IN WHICH A CONVERSATION TAKES PLACE WHICH SEEMS LIKELY TO COST PHILEAS
Chapter 3,FOGG DEAR
Chapter 3,"Phileas Fogg, having shut the door of his house at half-past eleven,"
Chapter 3,and having put his right foot before his left five hundred and
Chapter 3,"seventy-five times, and his left foot before his right five hundred and"
Chapter 3,"seventy-six times, reached the Reform Club, an imposing edifice in Pall"
Chapter 3,"Mall, which could not have cost less than three millions. He repaired"
Chapter 3,"at once to the dining-room, the nine windows of which open upon a"
Chapter 3,"tasteful garden, where the trees were already gilded with an autumn"
Chapter 3,"colouring; and took his place at the habitual table, the cover of which"
Chapter 3,"had already been laid for him. His breakfast consisted of a side-dish,"
Chapter 3,"a broiled fish with Reading sauce, a scarlet slice of roast beef"
Chapter 3,"garnished with mushrooms, a rhubarb and gooseberry tart, and a morsel"
Chapter 3,"of Cheshire cheese, the whole being washed down with several cups of"
Chapter 3,"tea, for which the Reform is famous. He rose at thirteen minutes to"
Chapter 3,"one, and directed his steps towards the large hall, a sumptuous"
Chapter 3,apartment adorned with lavishly-framed paintings. A flunkey handed him
Chapter 3,"an uncut _Times_, which he proceeded to cut with a skill which betrayed"
Chapter 3,familiarity with this delicate operation. The perusal of this paper
Chapter 3,"absorbed Phileas Fogg until a quarter before four, whilst the"
Chapter 3,"_Standard_, his next task, occupied him till the dinner hour. Dinner"
Chapter 3,"passed as breakfast had done, and Mr. Fogg re-appeared in the"
Chapter 3,reading-room and sat down to the _Pall Mall_ at twenty minutes before
Chapter 3,six. Half an hour later several members of the Reform came in and drew
Chapter 3,"up to the fireplace, where a coal fire was steadily burning. They were"
Chapter 3,"Mr. Fogg’s usual partners at whist: Andrew Stuart, an engineer; John"
Chapter 3,"Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, bankers; Thomas Flanagan, a brewer; and"
Chapter 3,"Gauthier Ralph, one of the Directors of the Bank of England—all rich"
Chapter 3,"and highly respectable personages, even in a club which comprises the"
Chapter 3,princes of English trade and finance.
Chapter 3,"“Well, Ralph,” said Thomas Flanagan, “what about that robbery?”"
Chapter 3,"“Oh,” replied Stuart, “the Bank will lose the money.”"
Chapter 3,"“On the contrary,” broke in Ralph, “I hope we may put our hands on the"
Chapter 3,robber. Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of
Chapter 3,"America and the Continent, and he’ll be a clever fellow if he slips"
Chapter 3,through their fingers.”
Chapter 3,“But have you got the robber’s description?” asked Stuart.
Chapter 3,"“In the first place, he is no robber at all,” returned Ralph,"
Chapter 3,positively.
Chapter 3,"“What! a fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds, no"
Chapter 3,robber?”
Chapter 3,“No.”
Chapter 3,"“Perhaps he’s a manufacturer, then.”"
Chapter 3,“The _Daily Telegraph_ says that he is a gentleman.”
Chapter 3,"It was Phileas Fogg, whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers,"
Chapter 3,"who made this remark. He bowed to his friends, and entered into the"
Chapter 3,"conversation. The affair which formed its subject, and which was town"
Chapter 3,"talk, had occurred three days before at the Bank of England. A package"
Chapter 3,"of banknotes, to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds, had been"
Chapter 3,"taken from the principal cashier’s table, that functionary being at the"
Chapter 3,moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and
Chapter 3,"sixpence. Of course, he could not have his eyes everywhere. Let it be"
Chapter 3,observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the
Chapter 3,honesty of the public. There are neither guards nor gratings to protect
Chapter 3,"its treasures; gold, silver, banknotes are freely exposed, at the mercy"
Chapter 3,"of the first comer. A keen observer of English customs relates that,"
Chapter 3,"being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the curiosity to"
Chapter 3,examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds. He took it
Chapter 3,"up, scrutinised it, passed it to his neighbour, he to the next man, and"
Chapter 3,"so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was transferred to the"
Chapter 3,end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place for half an hour.
Chapter 3,"Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as raised his head. But in the"
Chapter 3,present instance things had not gone so smoothly. The package of notes
Chapter 3,not being found when five o’clock sounded from the ponderous clock in
Chapter 3,"the “drawing office,” the amount was passed to the account of profit"
Chapter 3,"and loss. As soon as the robbery was discovered, picked detectives"
Chapter 3,"hastened off to Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez, Brindisi, New York,"
Chapter 3,"and other ports, inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand"
Chapter 3,"pounds, and five per cent. on the sum that might be recovered."
Chapter 3,Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived
Chapter 3,"at or left London by rail, and a judicial examination was at once"
Chapter 3,entered upon.
Chapter 3,"There were real grounds for supposing, as the _Daily Telegraph_ said,"
Chapter 3,that the thief did not belong to a professional band. On the day of the
Chapter 3,"robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners, and with a"
Chapter 3,"well-to-do air, had been observed going to and fro in the paying room"
Chapter 3,where the crime was committed. A description of him was easily procured
Chapter 3,"and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits, of whom Ralph was"
Chapter 3,"one, did not despair of his apprehension. The papers and clubs were"
Chapter 3,"full of the affair, and everywhere people were discussing the"
Chapter 3,probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the Reform Club was
Chapter 3,"especially agitated, several of its members being Bank officials."
Chapter 3,Ralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to
Chapter 3,"be in vain, for he thought that the prize offered would greatly"
Chapter 3,stimulate their zeal and activity. But Stuart was far from sharing this
Chapter 3,"confidence; and, as they placed themselves at the whist-table, they"
Chapter 3,"continued to argue the matter. Stuart and Flanagan played together,"
Chapter 3,while Phileas Fogg had Fallentin for his partner. As the game proceeded
Chapter 3,"the conversation ceased, excepting between the rubbers, when it revived"
Chapter 3,again.
Chapter 3,"“I maintain,” said Stuart, “that the chances are in favour of the"
Chapter 3,"thief, who must be a shrewd fellow.”"
Chapter 3,"“Well, but where can he fly to?” asked Ralph. “No country is safe for"
Chapter 3,him.”
Chapter 3,“Pshaw!”
Chapter 3,"“Where could he go, then?”"
Chapter 3,"“Oh, I don’t know that. The world is big enough.”"
Chapter 3,"“It was once,” said Phileas Fogg, in a low tone. “Cut, sir,” he added,"
Chapter 3,handing the cards to Thomas Flanagan.
Chapter 3,"The discussion fell during the rubber, after which Stuart took up its"
Chapter 3,thread.
Chapter 3,“What do you mean by ‘once’? Has the world grown smaller?”
Chapter 3,"“Certainly,” returned Ralph. “I agree with Mr. Fogg. The world has"
Chapter 3,"grown smaller, since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly"
Chapter 3,than a hundred years ago. And that is why the search for this thief
Chapter 3,will be more likely to succeed.”
Chapter 3,“And also why the thief can get away more easily.”
Chapter 3,"“Be so good as to play, Mr. Stuart,” said Phileas Fogg."
Chapter 3,"But the incredulous Stuart was not convinced, and when the hand was"
Chapter 3,"finished, said eagerly: “You have a strange way, Ralph, of proving that"
Chapter 3,"the world has grown smaller. So, because you can go round it in three"
Chapter 3,months—”
Chapter 3,"“In eighty days,” interrupted Phileas Fogg."
Chapter 3,"“That is true, gentlemen,” added John Sullivan. “Only eighty days, now"
Chapter 3,"that the section between Rothal and Allahabad, on the Great Indian"
Chapter 3,"Peninsula Railway, has been opened. Here is the estimate made by the"
Chapter 3,_Daily Telegraph:_—
Chapter 3,"From London to Suez _viâ_ Mont Cenis and Brindisi, by rail and"
Chapter 3,steamboats ................. 7 days
Chapter 3,"From Suez to Bombay, by steamer .................... 13 ”"
Chapter 3,"From Bombay to Calcutta, by rail ................... 3 ”"
Chapter 3,"From Calcutta to Hong Kong, by steamer ............. 13 ”"
Chapter 3,"From Hong Kong to Yokohama (Japan), by steamer ..... 6 ”"
Chapter 3,"From Yokohama to San Francisco, by steamer ......... 22 ”"
Chapter 3,"From San Francisco to New York, by rail ............. 7 ”"
Chapter 3,"From New York to London, by steamer and rail ........ 9 ”"
Chapter 3,-------
Chapter 3,Total ............................................ 80 days.”
Chapter 3,"“Yes, in eighty days!” exclaimed Stuart, who in his excitement made a"
Chapter 3,"false deal. “But that doesn’t take into account bad weather, contrary"
Chapter 3,"winds, shipwrecks, railway accidents, and so on.”"
Chapter 3,"“All included,” returned Phileas Fogg, continuing to play despite the"
Chapter 3,discussion.
Chapter 3,"“But suppose the Hindoos or Indians pull up the rails,” replied Stuart;"
Chapter 3,"“suppose they stop the trains, pillage the luggage-vans, and scalp the"
Chapter 3,passengers!”
Chapter 3,"“All included,” calmly retorted Fogg; adding, as he threw down the"
Chapter 3,"cards, “Two trumps.”"
Chapter 3,"Stuart, whose turn it was to deal, gathered them up, and went on: “You"
Chapter 3,"are right, theoretically, Mr. Fogg, but practically—”"
Chapter 3,"“Practically also, Mr. Stuart.”"
Chapter 3,“I’d like to see you do it in eighty days.”
Chapter 3,“It depends on you. Shall we go?”
Chapter 3,“Heaven preserve me! But I would wager four thousand pounds that such a
Chapter 3,"journey, made under these conditions, is impossible.”"
Chapter 3,"“Quite possible, on the contrary,” returned Mr. Fogg."
Chapter 3,"“Well, make it, then!”"
Chapter 3,“The journey round the world in eighty days?”
Chapter 3,“Yes.”
Chapter 3,“I should like nothing better.”
Chapter 3,“When?”
Chapter 3,“At once. Only I warn you that I shall do it at your expense.”
Chapter 3,"“It’s absurd!” cried Stuart, who was beginning to be annoyed at the"
Chapter 3,"persistency of his friend. “Come, let’s go on with the game.”"
Chapter 3,"“Deal over again, then,” said Phileas Fogg. “There’s a false deal.”"
Chapter 3,Stuart took up the pack with a feverish hand; then suddenly put them
Chapter 3,down again.
Chapter 3,"“Well, Mr. Fogg,” said he, “it shall be so: I will wager the four"
Chapter 3,thousand on it.”
Chapter 3,"“Calm yourself, my dear Stuart,” said Fallentin. “It’s only a joke.”"
Chapter 3,"“When I say I’ll wager,” returned Stuart, “I mean it.”"
Chapter 3,"“All right,” said Mr. Fogg; and, turning to the others, he continued:"
Chapter 3,“I have a deposit of twenty thousand at Baring’s which I will willingly
Chapter 3,risk upon it.”
Chapter 3,"“Twenty thousand pounds!” cried Sullivan. “Twenty thousand pounds,"
Chapter 3,which you would lose by a single accidental delay!”
Chapter 3,"“The unforeseen does not exist,” quietly replied Phileas Fogg."
Chapter 3,"“But, Mr. Fogg, eighty days are only the estimate of the least possible"
Chapter 3,time in which the journey can be made.”
Chapter 3,“A well-used minimum suffices for everything.”
Chapter 3,"“But, in order not to exceed it, you must jump mathematically from the"
Chapter 3,"trains upon the steamers, and from the steamers upon the trains again.”"
Chapter 3,“I will jump—mathematically.”
Chapter 3,“You are joking.”
Chapter 3,“A true Englishman doesn’t joke when he is talking about so serious a
Chapter 3,"thing as a wager,” replied Phileas Fogg, solemnly. “I will bet twenty"
Chapter 3,thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that I will make the tour of
Chapter 3,"the world in eighty days or less; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours,"
Chapter 3,or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes. Do you accept?”
Chapter 3,"“We accept,” replied Messrs. Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, Flanagan, and"
Chapter 3,"Ralph, after consulting each other."
Chapter 3,"“Good,” said Mr. Fogg. “The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before"
Chapter 3,nine. I will take it.”
Chapter 3,“This very evening?” asked Stuart.
Chapter 3,"“This very evening,” returned Phileas Fogg. He took out and consulted a"
Chapter 3,"pocket almanac, and added, “As today is Wednesday, the 2nd of October,"
Chapter 3,"I shall be due in London in this very room of the Reform Club, on"
Chapter 3,"Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine p.m.; or else"
Chapter 3,"the twenty thousand pounds, now deposited in my name at Baring’s, will"
Chapter 3,"belong to you, in fact and in right, gentlemen. Here is a cheque for"
Chapter 3,the amount.”
Chapter 3,A memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six
Chapter 3,"parties, during which Phileas Fogg preserved a stoical composure. He"
Chapter 3,"certainly did not bet to win, and had only staked the twenty thousand"
Chapter 3,"pounds, half of his fortune, because he foresaw that he might have to"
Chapter 3,"expend the other half to carry out this difficult, not to say"
Chapter 3,"unattainable, project. As for his antagonists, they seemed much"
Chapter 3,"agitated; not so much by the value of their stake, as because they had"
Chapter 3,some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their
Chapter 3,friend.
Chapter 3,"The clock struck seven, and the party offered to suspend the game so"
Chapter 3,that Mr. Fogg might make his preparations for departure.
Chapter 3,"“I am quite ready now,” was his tranquil response. “Diamonds are"
Chapter 3,"trumps: be so good as to play, gentlemen.”"
Chapter 4,CHAPTER IV.
Chapter 4,"IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG ASTOUNDS PASSEPARTOUT, HIS SERVANT"
Chapter 4,"Having won twenty guineas at whist, and taken leave of his friends,"
Chapter 4,"Phileas Fogg, at twenty-five minutes past seven, left the Reform Club."
Chapter 4,"Passepartout, who had conscientiously studied the programme of his"
Chapter 4,"duties, was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the"
Chapter 4,"inexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour; for, according to"
Chapter 4,"rule, he was not due in Saville Row until precisely midnight."
Chapter 4,"Mr. Fogg repaired to his bedroom, and called out, “Passepartout!”"
Chapter 4,Passepartout did not reply. It could not be he who was called; it was
Chapter 4,not the right hour.
Chapter 4,"“Passepartout!” repeated Mr. Fogg, without raising his voice."
Chapter 4,Passepartout made his appearance.
Chapter 4,"“I’ve called you twice,” observed his master."
Chapter 4,"“But it is not midnight,” responded the other, showing his watch."
Chapter 4,“I know it; I don’t blame you. We start for Dover and Calais in ten
Chapter 4,minutes.”
Chapter 4,A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout’s round face; clearly he had not
Chapter 4,comprehended his master.
Chapter 4,“Monsieur is going to leave home?”
Chapter 4,"“Yes,” returned Phileas Fogg. “We are going round the world.”"
Chapter 4,"Passepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up his"
Chapter 4,"hands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with stupefied"
Chapter 4,astonishment.
Chapter 4,“Round the world!” he murmured.
Chapter 4,"“In eighty days,” responded Mr. Fogg. “So we haven’t a moment to lose.”"
Chapter 4,"“But the trunks?” gasped Passepartout, unconsciously swaying his head"
Chapter 4,from right to left.
Chapter 4,"“We’ll have no trunks; only a carpet-bag, with two shirts and three"
Chapter 4,"pairs of stockings for me, and the same for you. We’ll buy our clothes"
Chapter 4,"on the way. Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak, and some"
Chapter 4,"stout shoes, though we shall do little walking. Make haste!”"
Chapter 4,"Passepartout tried to reply, but could not. He went out, mounted to his"
Chapter 4,"own room, fell into a chair, and muttered: “That’s good, that is! And"
Chapter 4,"I, who wanted to remain quiet!”"
Chapter 4,He mechanically set about making the preparations for departure. Around
Chapter 4,"the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No. Was this a joke,"
Chapter 4,"then? They were going to Dover; good! To Calais; good again! After all,"
Chapter 4,"Passepartout, who had been away from France five years, would not be"
Chapter 4,sorry to set foot on his native soil again. Perhaps they would go as
Chapter 4,"far as Paris, and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more. But"
Chapter 4,surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no
Chapter 4,"doubt—but, then, it was none the less true that he was going away, this"
Chapter 4,so domestic person hitherto!
Chapter 4,"By eight o’clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag,"
Chapter 4,"containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still"
Chapter 4,"troubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended"
Chapter 4,to Mr. Fogg.
Chapter 4,Mr. Fogg was quite ready. Under his arm might have been observed a
Chapter 4,red-bound copy of Bradshaw’s Continental Railway Steam Transit and
Chapter 4,"General Guide, with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of"
Chapter 4,"steamers and railways. He took the carpet-bag, opened it, and slipped"
Chapter 4,"into it a goodly roll of Bank of England notes, which would pass"
Chapter 4,wherever he might go.
Chapter 4,“You have forgotten nothing?” asked he.
Chapter 4,"“Nothing, monsieur.”"
Chapter 4,“My mackintosh and cloak?”
Chapter 4,“Here they are.”
Chapter 4,"“Good! Take this carpet-bag,” handing it to Passepartout. “Take good"
Chapter 4,"care of it, for there are twenty thousand pounds in it.”"
Chapter 4,"Passepartout nearly dropped the bag, as if the twenty thousand pounds"
Chapter 4,"were in gold, and weighed him down."
Chapter 4,"Master and man then descended, the street-door was double-locked, and"
Chapter 4,at the end of Saville Row they took a cab and drove rapidly to Charing
Chapter 4,Cross. The cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes
Chapter 4,"past eight. Passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master,"
Chapter 4,"who, after paying the cabman, was about to enter the station, when a"
Chapter 4,"poor beggar-woman, with a child in her arms, her naked feet smeared"
Chapter 4,"with mud, her head covered with a wretched bonnet, from which hung a"
Chapter 4,"tattered feather, and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl,"
Chapter 4,"approached, and mournfully asked for alms."
Chapter 4,"Mr. Fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist, and"
Chapter 4,"handed them to the beggar, saying, “Here, my good woman. I’m glad that"
Chapter 4,I met you;” and passed on.
Chapter 4,Passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes; his master’s action
Chapter 4,touched his susceptible heart.
Chapter 4,"Two first-class tickets for Paris having been speedily purchased, Mr."
Chapter 4,"Fogg was crossing the station to the train, when he perceived his five"
Chapter 4,friends of the Reform.
Chapter 4,"“Well, gentlemen,” said he, “I’m off, you see; and, if you will examine"
Chapter 4,"my passport when I get back, you will be able to judge whether I have"
Chapter 4,accomplished the journey agreed upon.”
Chapter 4,"“Oh, that would be quite unnecessary, Mr. Fogg,” said Ralph politely."
Chapter 4,"“We will trust your word, as a gentleman of honour.”"
Chapter 4,“You do not forget when you are due in London again?” asked Stuart.
Chapter 4,"“In eighty days; on Saturday, the 21st of December, 1872, at a quarter"
Chapter 4,"before nine p.m. Good-bye, gentlemen.”"
Chapter 4,Phileas Fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first-class
Chapter 4,carriage at twenty minutes before nine; five minutes later the whistle
Chapter 4,"screamed, and the train slowly glided out of the station."
Chapter 4,"The night was dark, and a fine, steady rain was falling. Phileas Fogg,"
Chapter 4,"snugly ensconced in his corner, did not open his lips. Passepartout,"
Chapter 4,"not yet recovered from his stupefaction, clung mechanically to the"
Chapter 4,"carpet-bag, with its enormous treasure."
Chapter 4,"Just as the train was whirling through Sydenham, Passepartout suddenly"
Chapter 4,uttered a cry of despair.
Chapter 4,“What’s the matter?” asked Mr. Fogg.
Chapter 4,“Alas! In my hurry—I—I forgot—”
Chapter 4,“What?”
Chapter 4,“To turn off the gas in my room!”
Chapter 4,"“Very well, young man,” returned Mr. Fogg, coolly; “it will burn—at"
Chapter 4,your expense.”
Chapter 5,CHAPTER V.
Chapter 5,"IN WHICH A NEW SPECIES OF FUNDS, UNKNOWN TO THE MONEYED MEN, APPEARS ON"
Chapter 5,’CHANGE
Chapter 5,Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would
Chapter 5,create a lively sensation at the West End. The news of the bet spread
Chapter 5,"through the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting topic of conversation"
Chapter 5,to its members. From the club it soon got into the papers throughout
Chapter 5,"England. The boasted “tour of the world” was talked about, disputed,"
Chapter 5,argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama
Chapter 5,"claim. Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook"
Chapter 5,"their heads and declared against him; it was absurd, impossible, they"
Chapter 5,"declared, that the tour of the world could be made, except"
Chapter 5,"theoretically and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the"
Chapter 5,"existing means of travelling. The _Times, Standard, Morning Post_, and"
Chapter 5,"_Daily News_, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted"
Chapter 5,Mr. Fogg’s project as madness; the _Daily Telegraph_ alone hesitatingly
Chapter 5,"supported him. People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his"
Chapter 5,Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the
Chapter 5,mental aberration of its proposer.
Chapter 5,"Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, for"
Chapter 5,geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns
Chapter 5,devoted to Phileas Fogg’s venture were eagerly devoured by all classes
Chapter 5,"of readers. At first some rash individuals, principally of the gentler"
Chapter 5,"sex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the"
Chapter 5,"_Illustrated London News_ came out with his portrait, copied from a"
Chapter 5,photograph in the Reform Club. A few readers of the _Daily Telegraph_
Chapter 5,"even dared to say, “Why not, after all? Stranger things have come to"
Chapter 5,pass.”
Chapter 5,"At last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in the bulletin"
Chapter 5,"of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the question from"
Chapter 5,"every point of view, and demonstrated the utter folly of the"
Chapter 5,enterprise.
Chapter 5,"Everything, it said, was against the travellers, every obstacle imposed"
Chapter 5,alike by man and by nature. A miraculous agreement of the times of
Chapter 5,"departure and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary"
Chapter 5,"to his success. He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains at"
Chapter 5,"the designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively"
Chapter 5,"moderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, and"
Chapter 5,"the United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon"
Chapter 5,"accomplishing his task? There were accidents to machinery, the"
Chapter 5,"liability of trains to run off the line, collisions, bad weather, the"
Chapter 5,blocking up by snow—were not all these against Phileas Fogg? Would he
Chapter 5,"not find himself, when travelling by steamer in winter, at the mercy of"
Chapter 5,the winds and fogs? Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be
Chapter 5,two or three days behind time? But a single delay would suffice to
Chapter 5,fatally break the chain of communication; should Phileas Fogg once
Chapter 5,"miss, even by an hour; a steamer, he would have to wait for the next,"
Chapter 5,and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain.
Chapter 5,"This article made a great deal of noise, and, being copied into all the"
Chapter 5,"papers, seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist."
Chapter 5,"Everybody knows that England is the world of betting men, who are of a"
Chapter 5,higher class than mere gamblers; to bet is in the English temperament.
Chapter 5,"Not only the members of the Reform, but the general public, made heavy"
Chapter 5,"wagers for or against Phileas Fogg, who was set down in the betting"
Chapter 5,"books as if he were a race-horse. Bonds were issued, and made their"
Chapter 5,appearance on ’Change; “Phileas Fogg bonds” were offered at par or at a
Chapter 5,"premium, and a great business was done in them. But five days after the"
Chapter 5,"article in the bulletin of the Geographical Society appeared, the"
Chapter 5,demand began to subside: “Phileas Fogg” declined. They were offered by
Chapter 5,"packages, at first of five, then of ten, until at last nobody would"
Chapter 5,"take less than twenty, fifty, a hundred!"
Chapter 5,"Lord Albemarle, an elderly paralytic gentleman, was now the only"
Chapter 5,"advocate of Phileas Fogg left. This noble lord, who was fastened to his"
Chapter 5,"chair, would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the"
Chapter 5,"world, if it took ten years; and he bet five thousand pounds on Phileas"
Chapter 5,Fogg. When the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was
Chapter 5,"pointed out to him, he contented himself with replying, “If the thing"
Chapter 5,"is feasible, the first to do it ought to be an Englishman.”"
Chapter 5,"The Fogg party dwindled more and more, everybody was going against him,"
Chapter 5,and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one; and a
Chapter 5,week after his departure an incident occurred which deprived him of
Chapter 5,backers at any price.
Chapter 5,The commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine o’clock
Chapter 5,"one evening, when the following telegraphic dispatch was put into his"
Chapter 5,hands:
Chapter 5,_Suez to London._
Chapter 5,"ROWAN, COMMISSIONER OF POLICE, SCOTLAND YARD:"
Chapter 5,"I’ve found the bank robber, Phileas Fogg. Send without delay"
Chapter 5,warrant of arrest to Bombay.
Chapter 5,"FIX, _Detective_."
Chapter 5,The effect of this dispatch was instantaneous. The polished gentleman
Chapter 5,"disappeared to give place to the bank robber. His photograph, which was"
Chapter 5,"hung with those of the rest of the members at the Reform Club, was"
Chapter 5,"minutely examined, and it betrayed, feature by feature, the description"
Chapter 5,of the robber which had been provided to the police. The mysterious
Chapter 5,"habits of Phileas Fogg were recalled; his solitary ways, his sudden"
Chapter 5,"departure; and it seemed clear that, in undertaking a tour round the"
Chapter 5,"world on the pretext of a wager, he had had no other end in view than"
Chapter 5,"to elude the detectives, and throw them off his track."
Chapter 6,CHAPTER VI.
Chapter 6,"IN WHICH FIX, THE DETECTIVE, BETRAYS A VERY NATURAL IMPATIENCE"
Chapter 6,The circumstances under which this telegraphic dispatch about Phileas
Chapter 6,Fogg was sent were as follows:
Chapter 6,"The steamer “Mongolia,” belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental"
Chapter 6,"Company, built of iron, of two thousand eight hundred tons burden, and"
Chapter 6,"five hundred horse-power, was due at eleven o’clock a.m. on Wednesday,"
Chapter 6,"the 9th of October, at Suez. The “Mongolia” plied regularly between"
Chapter 6,"Brindisi and Bombay _viâ_ the Suez Canal, and was one of the fastest"
Chapter 6,"steamers belonging to the company, always making more than ten knots an"
Chapter 6,"hour between Brindisi and Suez, and nine and a half between Suez and"
Chapter 6,Bombay.
Chapter 6,"Two men were promenading up and down the wharves, among the crowd of"
Chapter 6,natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once straggling
Chapter 6,"village—now, thanks to the enterprise of M. Lesseps, a fast-growing"
Chapter 6,"town. One was the British consul at Suez, who, despite the prophecies"
Chapter 6,"of the English Government, and the unfavourable predictions of"
Chapter 6,"Stephenson, was in the habit of seeing, from his office window, English"
Chapter 6,"ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal, by which the old"
Chapter 6,roundabout route from England to India by the Cape of Good Hope was
Chapter 6,"abridged by at least a half. The other was a small, slight-built"
Chapter 6,"personage, with a nervous, intelligent face, and bright eyes peering"
Chapter 6,out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching. He was just
Chapter 6,"now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience, nervously pacing up"
Chapter 6,"and down, and unable to stand still for a moment. This was Fix, one of"
Chapter 6,the detectives who had been dispatched from England in search of the
Chapter 6,bank robber; it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who
Chapter 6,"arrived at Suez, and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious"
Chapter 6,"characters, or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal,"
Chapter 6,which he had received two days before from the police headquarters at
Chapter 6,London. The detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining
Chapter 6,"the splendid reward which would be the prize of success, and awaited"
Chapter 6,"with a feverish impatience, easy to understand, the arrival of the"
Chapter 6,steamer “Mongolia.”
Chapter 6,"“So you say, consul,” asked he for the twentieth time, “that this"
Chapter 6,steamer is never behind time?”
Chapter 6,"“No, Mr. Fix,” replied the consul. “She was bespoken yesterday at Port"
Chapter 6,"Said, and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft. I"
Chapter 6,repeat that the ‘Mongolia’ has been in advance of the time required by
Chapter 6,"the company’s regulations, and gained the prize awarded for excess of"
Chapter 6,speed.”
Chapter 6,“Does she come directly from Brindisi?”
Chapter 6,"“Directly from Brindisi; she takes on the Indian mails there, and she"
Chapter 6,"left there Saturday at five p.m. Have patience, Mr. Fix; she will not"
Chapter 6,"be late. But really, I don’t see how, from the description you have,"
Chapter 6,"you will be able to recognise your man, even if he is on board the"
Chapter 6,‘Mongolia.’”
Chapter 6,"“A man rather feels the presence of these fellows, consul, than"
Chapter 6,"recognises them. You must have a scent for them, and a scent is like a"
Chapter 6,"sixth sense which combines hearing, seeing, and smelling. I’ve arrested"
Chapter 6,"more than one of these gentlemen in my time, and, if my thief is on"
Chapter 6,"board, I’ll answer for it; he’ll not slip through my fingers.”"
Chapter 6,"“I hope so, Mr. Fix, for it was a heavy robbery.”"
Chapter 6,"“A magnificent robbery, consul; fifty-five thousand pounds! We don’t"
Chapter 6,often have such windfalls. Burglars are getting to be so contemptible
Chapter 6,nowadays! A fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings!”
Chapter 6,"“Mr. Fix,” said the consul, “I like your way of talking, and hope"
Chapter 6,you’ll succeed; but I fear you will find it far from easy. Don’t you
Chapter 6,"see, the description which you have there has a singular resemblance to"
Chapter 6,an honest man?”
Chapter 6,"“Consul,” remarked the detective, dogmatically, “great robbers always"
Chapter 6,resemble honest folks. Fellows who have rascally faces have only one
Chapter 6,"course to take, and that is to remain honest; otherwise they would be"
Chapter 6,"arrested off-hand. The artistic thing is, to unmask honest"
Chapter 6,"countenances; it’s no light task, I admit, but a real art.”"
Chapter 6,Mr. Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit.
Chapter 6,Little by little the scene on the quay became more animated; sailors of
Chapter 6,"various nations, merchants, ship-brokers, porters, fellahs, bustled to"
Chapter 6,and fro as if the steamer were immediately expected. The weather was
Chapter 6,"clear, and slightly chilly. The minarets of the town loomed above the"
Chapter 6,"houses in the pale rays of the sun. A jetty pier, some two thousand"
Chapter 6,"yards along, extended into the roadstead. A number of fishing-smacks"
Chapter 6,"and coasting boats, some retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient"
Chapter 6,"galleys, were discernible on the Red Sea."
Chapter 6,"As he passed among the busy crowd, Fix, according to habit, scrutinised"
Chapter 6,"the passers-by with a keen, rapid glance."
Chapter 6,It was now half-past ten.
Chapter 6,"“The steamer doesn’t come!” he exclaimed, as the port clock struck."
Chapter 6,"“She can’t be far off now,” returned his companion."
Chapter 6,“How long will she stop at Suez?”
Chapter 6,“Four hours; long enough to get in her coal. It is thirteen hundred and
Chapter 6,"ten miles from Suez to Aden, at the other end of the Red Sea, and she"
Chapter 6,has to take in a fresh coal supply.”
Chapter 6,“And does she go from Suez directly to Bombay?”
Chapter 6,“Without putting in anywhere.”
Chapter 6,“Good!” said Fix. “If the robber is on board he will no doubt get off
Chapter 6,"at Suez, so as to reach the Dutch or French colonies in Asia by some"
Chapter 6,other route. He ought to know that he would not be safe an hour in
Chapter 6,"India, which is English soil.”"
Chapter 6,"“Unless,” objected the consul, “he is exceptionally shrewd. An English"
Chapter 6,"criminal, you know, is always better concealed in London than anywhere"
Chapter 6,else.”
Chapter 6,"This observation furnished the detective food for thought, and"
Chapter 6,"meanwhile the consul went away to his office. Fix, left alone, was more"
Chapter 6,"impatient than ever, having a presentiment that the robber was on board"
Chapter 6,the “Mongolia.” If he had indeed left London intending to reach the New
Chapter 6,"World, he would naturally take the route _viâ_ India, which was less"
Chapter 6,watched and more difficult to watch than that of the Atlantic. But
Chapter 6,Fix’s reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp
Chapter 6,"whistles, which announced the arrival of the “Mongolia.” The porters"
Chapter 6,"and fellahs rushed down the quay, and a dozen boats pushed off from the"
Chapter 6,shore to go and meet the steamer. Soon her gigantic hull appeared
Chapter 6,"passing along between the banks, and eleven o’clock struck as she"
Chapter 6,"anchored in the road. She brought an unusual number of passengers, some"
Chapter 6,"of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town,"
Chapter 6,"while the greater part disembarked in the boats, and landed on the"
Chapter 6,quay.
Chapter 6,"Fix took up a position, and carefully examined each face and figure"
Chapter 6,"which made its appearance. Presently one of the passengers, after"
Chapter 6,"vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters,"
Chapter 6,came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the English
Chapter 6,"consulate, at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have"
Chapter 6,"_visaed_. Fix instinctively took the passport, and with a rapid glance"
Chapter 6,read the description of its bearer. An involuntary motion of surprise
Chapter 6,"nearly escaped him, for the description in the passport was identical"
Chapter 6,with that of the bank robber which he had received from Scotland Yard.
Chapter 6,“Is this your passport?” asked he.
Chapter 6,"“No, it’s my master’s.”"
Chapter 6,“And your master is—”
Chapter 6,“He stayed on board.”
Chapter 6,"“But he must go to the consul’s in person, so as to establish his"
Chapter 6,identity.”
Chapter 6,"“Oh, is that necessary?”"
Chapter 6,“Quite indispensable.”
Chapter 6,“And where is the consulate?”
Chapter 6,"“There, on the corner of the square,” said Fix, pointing to a house two"
Chapter 6,hundred steps off.
Chapter 6,"“I’ll go and fetch my master, who won’t be much pleased, however, to be"
Chapter 6,disturbed.”
Chapter 6,"The passenger bowed to Fix, and returned to the steamer."
Chapter 7,CHAPTER VII.
Chapter 7,WHICH ONCE MORE DEMONSTRATES THE USELESSNESS OF PASSPORTS AS AIDS TO
Chapter 7,DETECTIVES
Chapter 7,"The detective passed down the quay, and rapidly made his way to the"
Chapter 7,"consul’s office, where he was at once admitted to the presence of that"
Chapter 7,official.
Chapter 7,"“Consul,” said he, without preamble, “I have strong reasons for"
Chapter 7,believing that my man is a passenger on the ‘Mongolia.’” And he
Chapter 7,narrated what had just passed concerning the passport.
Chapter 7,"“Well, Mr. Fix,” replied the consul, “I shall not be sorry to see the"
Chapter 7,"rascal’s face; but perhaps he won’t come here—that is, if he is the"
Chapter 7,person you suppose him to be. A robber doesn’t quite like to leave
Chapter 7,"traces of his flight behind him; and, besides, he is not obliged to"
Chapter 7,have his passport countersigned.”
Chapter 7,"“If he is as shrewd as I think he is, consul, he will come.”"
Chapter 7,“To have his passport _visaed?_”
Chapter 7,"“Yes. Passports are only good for annoying honest folks, and aiding in"
Chapter 7,the flight of rogues. I assure you it will be quite the thing for him
Chapter 7,to do; but I hope you will not _visa_ the passport.”
Chapter 7,“Why not? If the passport is genuine I have no right to refuse.”
Chapter 7,"“Still, I must keep this man here until I can get a warrant to arrest"
Chapter 7,him from London.”
Chapter 7,"“Ah, that’s your look-out. But I cannot—”"
Chapter 7,"The consul did not finish his sentence, for as he spoke a knock was"
Chapter 7,"heard at the door, and two strangers entered, one of whom was the"
Chapter 7,"servant whom Fix had met on the quay. The other, who was his master,"
Chapter 7,held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the
Chapter 7,favour to _visa_ it. The consul took the document and carefully read
Chapter 7,"it, whilst Fix observed, or rather devoured, the stranger with his eyes"
Chapter 7,from a corner of the room.
Chapter 7,"“You are Mr. Phileas Fogg?” said the consul, after reading the"
Chapter 7,passport.
Chapter 7,“I am.”
Chapter 7,“And this man is your servant?”
Chapter 7,"“He is: a Frenchman, named Passepartout.”"
Chapter 7,“You are from London?”
Chapter 7,“Yes.”
Chapter 7,“And you are going—”
Chapter 7,“To Bombay.”
Chapter 7,"“Very good, sir. You know that a _visa_ is useless, and that no"
Chapter 7,passport is required?”
Chapter 7,"“I know it, sir,” replied Phileas Fogg; “but I wish to prove, by your"
Chapter 7,"_visa_, that I came by Suez.”"
Chapter 7,"“Very well, sir.”"
Chapter 7,"The consul proceeded to sign and date the passport, after which he"
Chapter 7,"added his official seal. Mr. Fogg paid the customary fee, coldly bowed,"
Chapter 7,"and went out, followed by his servant."
Chapter 7,“Well?” queried the detective.
Chapter 7,"“Well, he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man,” replied the"
Chapter 7,consul.
Chapter 7,"“Possibly; but that is not the question. Do you think, consul, that"
Chapter 7,"this phlegmatic gentleman resembles, feature by feature, the robber"
Chapter 7,whose description I have received?”
Chapter 7,"“I concede that; but then, you know, all descriptions—”"
Chapter 7,"“I’ll make certain of it,” interrupted Fix. “The servant seems to me"
Chapter 7,"less mysterious than the master; besides, he’s a Frenchman, and can’t"
Chapter 7,"help talking. Excuse me for a little while, consul.”"
Chapter 7,Fix started off in search of Passepartout.
Chapter 7,"Meanwhile Mr. Fogg, after leaving the consulate, repaired to the quay,"
Chapter 7,"gave some orders to Passepartout, went off to the “Mongolia” in a boat,"
Chapter 7,"and descended to his cabin. He took up his note-book, which contained"
Chapter 7,the following memoranda:
Chapter 7,"“Left London, Wednesday, October 2nd, at 8.45 p.m."
Chapter 7,"“Reached Paris, Thursday, October 3rd, at 7.20 a.m."
Chapter 7,"“Left Paris, Thursday, at 8.40 a.m."
Chapter 7,"“Reached Turin by Mont Cenis, Friday, October 4th, at 6.35 a.m."
Chapter 7,"“Left Turin, Friday, at 7.20 a.m."
Chapter 7,"“Arrived at Brindisi, Saturday, October 5th, at 4 p.m."
Chapter 7,"“Sailed on the ‘Mongolia,’ Saturday, at 5 p.m."
Chapter 7,"“Reached Suez, Wednesday, October 9th, at 11 a.m."
Chapter 7,"“Total of hours spent, 158½; or, in days, six days and a half.”"
Chapter 7,"These dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns,"
Chapter 7,"indicating the month, the day of the month, and the day for the"
Chapter 7,"stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point Paris, Brindisi,"
Chapter 7,"Suez, Bombay, Calcutta, Singapore, Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco,"
Chapter 7,"New York, and London—from the 2nd of October to the 21st of December;"
Chapter 7,and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered
Chapter 7,on arrival at each locality. This methodical record thus contained an
Chapter 7,"account of everything needed, and Mr. Fogg always knew whether he was"
Chapter 7,"behind-hand or in advance of his time. On this Friday, October 9th, he"
Chapter 7,"noted his arrival at Suez, and observed that he had as yet neither"
Chapter 7,"gained nor lost. He sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin, never"
Chapter 7,"once thinking of inspecting the town, being one of those Englishmen who"
Chapter 7,are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics.
Chapter 8,CHAPTER VIII.
Chapter 8,"IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TALKS RATHER MORE, PERHAPS, THAN IS PRUDENT"
Chapter 8,"Fix soon rejoined Passepartout, who was lounging and looking about on"
Chapter 8,"the quay, as if he did not feel that he, at least, was obliged not to"
Chapter 8,see anything.
Chapter 8,"“Well, my friend,” said the detective, coming up with him, “is your"
Chapter 8,passport _visaed?_”
Chapter 8,"“Ah, it’s you, is it, monsieur?” responded Passepartout. “Thanks, yes,"
Chapter 8,the passport is all right.”
Chapter 8,“And you are looking about you?”
Chapter 8,“Yes; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream. So
Chapter 8,this is Suez?”
Chapter 8,“Yes.”
Chapter 8,“In Egypt?”
Chapter 8,"“Certainly, in Egypt.”"
Chapter 8,“And in Africa?”
Chapter 8,“In Africa.”
Chapter 8,"“In Africa!” repeated Passepartout. “Just think, monsieur, I had no"
Chapter 8,idea that we should go farther than Paris; and all that I saw of Paris
Chapter 8,was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in
Chapter 8,"the morning, between the Northern and the Lyons stations, through the"
Chapter 8,"windows of a car, and in a driving rain! How I regret not having seen"
Chapter 8,once more Père la Chaise and the circus in the Champs Elysées!”
Chapter 8,"“You are in a great hurry, then?”"
Chapter 8,"“I am not, but my master is. By the way, I must buy some shoes and"
Chapter 8,"shirts. We came away without trunks, only with a carpet-bag.”"
Chapter 8,“I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want.”
Chapter 8,"“Really, monsieur, you are very kind.”"
Chapter 8,"And they walked off together, Passepartout chatting volubly as they"
Chapter 8,went along.
Chapter 8,"“Above all,” said he; “don’t let me lose the steamer.”"
Chapter 8,“You have plenty of time; it’s only twelve o’clock.”
Chapter 8,"Passepartout pulled out his big watch. “Twelve!” he exclaimed; “why,"
Chapter 8,it’s only eight minutes before ten.”
Chapter 8,“Your watch is slow.”
Chapter 8,"“My watch? A family watch, monsieur, which has come down from my"
Chapter 8,great-grandfather! It doesn’t vary five minutes in the year. It’s a
Chapter 8,"perfect chronometer, look you.”"
Chapter 8,"“I see how it is,” said Fix. “You have kept London time, which is two"
Chapter 8,hours behind that of Suez. You ought to regulate your watch at noon in
Chapter 8,each country.”
Chapter 8,“I regulate my watch? Never!”
Chapter 8,"“Well, then, it will not agree with the sun.”"
Chapter 8,"“So much the worse for the sun, monsieur. The sun will be wrong, then!”"
Chapter 8,And the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant
Chapter 8,"gesture. After a few minutes silence, Fix resumed: “You left London"
Chapter 8,"hastily, then?”"
Chapter 8,"“I rather think so! Last Friday at eight o’clock in the evening,"
Chapter 8,"Monsieur Fogg came home from his club, and three-quarters of an hour"
Chapter 8,afterwards we were off.”
Chapter 8,“But where is your master going?”
Chapter 8,“Always straight ahead. He is going round the world.”
Chapter 8,“Round the world?” cried Fix.
Chapter 8,"“Yes, and in eighty days! He says it is on a wager; but, between us, I"
Chapter 8,don’t believe a word of it. That wouldn’t be common sense. There’s
Chapter 8,something else in the wind.”
Chapter 8,"“Ah! Mr. Fogg is a character, is he?”"
Chapter 8,“I should say he was.”
Chapter 8,“Is he rich?”
Chapter 8,"“No doubt, for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes"
Chapter 8,"with him. And he doesn’t spare the money on the way, either: he has"
Chapter 8,offered a large reward to the engineer of the ‘Mongolia’ if he gets us
Chapter 8,to Bombay well in advance of time.”
Chapter 8,“And you have known your master a long time?”
Chapter 8,"“Why, no; I entered his service the very day we left London.”"
Chapter 8,The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited
Chapter 8,detective may be imagined. The hasty departure from London soon after
Chapter 8,the robbery; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg; his eagerness to reach
Chapter 8,distant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet—all
Chapter 8,"confirmed Fix in his theory. He continued to pump poor Passepartout,"
Chapter 8,"and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master, who"
Chapter 8,"lived a solitary existence in London, was said to be rich, though no"
Chapter 8,"one knew whence came his riches, and was mysterious and impenetrable in"
Chapter 8,his affairs and habits. Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land
Chapter 8,"at Suez, but was really going on to Bombay."
Chapter 8,“Is Bombay far from here?” asked Passepartout.
Chapter 8,“Pretty far. It is a ten days’ voyage by sea.”
Chapter 8,“And in what country is Bombay?”
Chapter 8,“India.”
Chapter 8,“In Asia?”
Chapter 8,“Certainly.”
Chapter 8,“The deuce! I was going to tell you there’s one thing that worries
Chapter 8,me—my burner!”
Chapter 8,“What burner?”
Chapter 8,"“My gas-burner, which I forgot to turn off, and which is at this moment"
Chapter 8,"burning at my expense. I have calculated, monsieur, that I lose two"
Chapter 8,"shillings every four and twenty hours, exactly sixpence more than I"
Chapter 8,earn; and you will understand that the longer our journey—”
Chapter 8,Did Fix pay any attention to Passepartout’s trouble about the gas? It
Chapter 8,"is not probable. He was not listening, but was cogitating a project."
Chapter 8,"Passepartout and he had now reached the shop, where Fix left his"
Chapter 8,"companion to make his purchases, after recommending him not to miss the"
Chapter 8,"steamer, and hurried back to the consulate. Now that he was fully"
Chapter 8,"convinced, Fix had quite recovered his equanimity."
Chapter 8,"“Consul,” said he, “I have no longer any doubt. I have spotted my man."
Chapter 8,He passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in
Chapter 8,eighty days.”
Chapter 8,"“Then he’s a sharp fellow,” returned the consul, “and counts on"
Chapter 8,returning to London after putting the police of the two countries off
Chapter 8,his track.”
Chapter 8,"“We’ll see about that,” replied Fix."
Chapter 8,“But are you not mistaken?”
Chapter 8,“I am not mistaken.”
Chapter 8,"“Why was this robber so anxious to prove, by the _visa_, that he had"
Chapter 8,passed through Suez?”
Chapter 8,“Why? I have no idea; but listen to me.”
Chapter 8,He reported in a few words the most important parts of his conversation
Chapter 8,with Passepartout.
Chapter 8,"“In short,” said the consul, “appearances are wholly against this man."
Chapter 8,And what are you going to do?”
Chapter 8,“Send a dispatch to London for a warrant of arrest to be dispatched
Chapter 8,"instantly to Bombay, take passage on board the ‘Mongolia,’ follow my"
Chapter 8,"rogue to India, and there, on English ground, arrest him politely, with"
Chapter 8,"my warrant in my hand, and my hand on his shoulder.”"
Chapter 8,"Having uttered these words with a cool, careless air, the detective"
Chapter 8,"took leave of the consul, and repaired to the telegraph office, whence"
Chapter 8,he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the London police office. A
Chapter 8,"quarter of an hour later found Fix, with a small bag in his hand,"
Chapter 8,"proceeding on board the “Mongolia;” and, ere many moments longer, the"
Chapter 8,noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the Red Sea.
Chapter 9,CHAPTER IX.
Chapter 9,IN WHICH THE RED SEA AND THE INDIAN OCEAN PROVE PROPITIOUS TO THE
Chapter 9,DESIGNS OF PHILEAS FOGG
Chapter 9,The distance between Suez and Aden is precisely thirteen hundred and
Chapter 9,"ten miles, and the regulations of the company allow the steamers one"
Chapter 9,"hundred and thirty-eight hours in which to traverse it. The “Mongolia,”"
Chapter 9,"thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer, seemed likely, so"
Chapter 9,"rapid was her speed, to reach her destination considerably within that"
Chapter 9,time. The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for
Chapter 9,"India some for Bombay, others for Calcutta by way of Bombay, the"
Chapter 9,"nearest route thither, now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula."
Chapter 9,Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of
Chapter 9,"various grades, the latter being either attached to the regular British"
Chapter 9,"forces or commanding the Sepoy troops, and receiving high salaries ever"
Chapter 9,since the central government has assumed the powers of the East India
Chapter 9,"Company: for the sub-lieutenants get £280, brigadiers, £2,400, and"
Chapter 9,"generals of divisions, £4,000. What with the military men, a number of"
Chapter 9,"rich young Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable efforts of"
Chapter 9,"the purser, the time passed quickly on the “Mongolia.” The best of fare"
Chapter 9,"was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the"
Chapter 9,"eight o’clock supper, and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets"
Chapter 9,"twice a day; and the hours were whirled away, when the sea was"
Chapter 9,"tranquil, with music, dancing, and games."
Chapter 9,"But the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like most"
Chapter 9,long and narrow gulfs. When the wind came from the African or Asian
Chapter 9,"coast the “Mongolia,” with her long hull, rolled fearfully. Then the"
Chapter 9,ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; singing and
Chapter 9,"dancing suddenly ceased. Yet the good ship ploughed straight on,"
Chapter 9,"unretarded by wind or wave, towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. What"
Chapter 9,"was Phileas Fogg doing all this time? It might be thought that, in his"
Chapter 9,"anxiety, he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind, the"
Chapter 9,"disorderly raging of the billows—every chance, in short, which might"
Chapter 9,"force the “Mongolia” to slacken her speed, and thus interrupt his"
Chapter 9,"journey. But, if he thought of these possibilities, he did not betray"
Chapter 9,the fact by any outward sign.
Chapter 9,"Always the same impassible member of the Reform Club, whom no incident"
Chapter 9,"could surprise, as unvarying as the ship’s chronometers, and seldom"
Chapter 9,"having the curiosity even to go upon the deck, he passed through the"
Chapter 9,memorable scenes of the Red Sea with cold indifference; did not care to
Chapter 9,"recognise the historic towns and villages which, along its borders,"
Chapter 9,raised their picturesque outlines against the sky; and betrayed no fear
Chapter 9,"of the dangers of the Arabic Gulf, which the old historians always"
Chapter 9,"spoke of with horror, and upon which the ancient navigators never"
Chapter 9,ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices. How did
Chapter 9,this eccentric personage pass his time on the “Mongolia”? He made his
Chapter 9,"four hearty meals every day, regardless of the most persistent rolling"
Chapter 9,and pitching on the part of the steamer; and he played whist
Chapter 9,"indefatigably, for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as"
Chapter 9,"himself. A tax-collector, on the way to his post at Goa; the Rev."
Chapter 9,"Decimus Smith, returning to his parish at Bombay; and a"
Chapter 9,"brigadier-general of the English army, who was about to rejoin his"
Chapter 9,"brigade at Benares, made up the party, and, with Mr. Fogg, played whist"
Chapter 9,by the hour together in absorbing silence.
Chapter 9,"As for Passepartout, he, too, had escaped sea-sickness, and took his"
Chapter 9,meals conscientiously in the forward cabin. He rather enjoyed the
Chapter 9,"voyage, for he was well fed and well lodged, took a great interest in"
Chapter 9,"the scenes through which they were passing, and consoled himself with"
Chapter 9,the delusion that his master’s whim would end at Bombay. He was
Chapter 9,"pleased, on the day after leaving Suez, to find on deck the obliging"
Chapter 9,person with whom he had walked and chatted on the quays.
Chapter 9,"“If I am not mistaken,” said he, approaching this person, with his most"
Chapter 9,"amiable smile, “you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to"
Chapter 9,guide me at Suez?”
Chapter 9,“Ah! I quite recognise you. You are the servant of the strange
Chapter 9,Englishman—”
Chapter 9,"“Just so, monsieur—”"
Chapter 9,“Fix.”
Chapter 9,"“Monsieur Fix,” resumed Passepartout, “I’m charmed to find you on"
Chapter 9,board. Where are you bound?”
Chapter 9,"“Like you, to Bombay.”"
Chapter 9,“That’s capital! Have you made this trip before?”
Chapter 9,“Several times. I am one of the agents of the Peninsular Company.”
Chapter 9,“Then you know India?”
Chapter 9,"“Why yes,” replied Fix, who spoke cautiously."
Chapter 9,"“A curious place, this India?”"
Chapter 9,"“Oh, very curious. Mosques, minarets, temples, fakirs, pagodas, tigers,"
Chapter 9,"snakes, elephants! I hope you will have ample time to see the sights.”"
Chapter 9,"“I hope so, Monsieur Fix. You see, a man of sound sense ought not to"
Chapter 9,"spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train, and from a"
Chapter 9,"railway train upon a steamer again, pretending to make the tour of the"
Chapter 9,"world in eighty days! No; all these gymnastics, you may be sure, will"
Chapter 9,cease at Bombay.”
Chapter 9,"“And Mr. Fogg is getting on well?” asked Fix, in the most natural tone"
Chapter 9,in the world.
Chapter 9,"“Quite well, and I too. I eat like a famished ogre; it’s the sea air.”"
Chapter 9,“But I never see your master on deck.”
Chapter 9,“Never; he hasn’t the least curiosity.”
Chapter 9,"“Do you know, Mr. Passepartout, that this pretended tour in eighty days"
Chapter 9,may conceal some secret errand—perhaps a diplomatic mission?”
Chapter 9,"“Faith, Monsieur Fix, I assure you I know nothing about it, nor would I"
Chapter 9,give half a crown to find out.”
Chapter 9,"After this meeting, Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of chatting"
Chapter 9,"together, the latter making it a point to gain the worthy man’s"
Chapter 9,confidence. He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale in
Chapter 9,"the steamer bar-room, which Passepartout never failed to accept with"
Chapter 9,"graceful alacrity, mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows."
Chapter 9,"Meanwhile the “Mongolia” was pushing forward rapidly; on the 13th,"
Chapter 9,"Mocha, surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing,"
Chapter 9,"was sighted, and on the mountains beyond were espied vast"
Chapter 9,coffee-fields. Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated
Chapter 9,"place, and thought that, with its circular walls and dismantled fort,"
Chapter 9,it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer. The following night
Chapter 9,"they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, which means in Arabic"
Chapter 9,"“The Bridge of Tears,” and the next day they put in at Steamer Point,"
Chapter 9,"north-west of Aden harbour, to take in coal. This matter of fuelling"
Chapter 9,steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal-mines; it
Chapter 9,costs the Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year.
Chapter 9,"In these distant seas, coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a"
Chapter 9,ton.
Chapter 9,The “Mongolia” had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse
Chapter 9,"before reaching Bombay, and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer"
Chapter 9,"Point to coal up. But this delay, as it was foreseen, did not affect"
Chapter 9,"Phileas Fogg’s programme; besides, the “Mongolia,” instead of reaching"
Chapter 9,"Aden on the morning of the 15th, when she was due, arrived there on the"
Chapter 9,"evening of the 14th, a gain of fifteen hours."
Chapter 9,Mr. Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport again
Chapter 9,"_visaed;_ Fix, unobserved, followed them. The _visa_ procured, Mr. Fogg"
Chapter 9,"returned on board to resume his former habits; while Passepartout,"
Chapter 9,"according to custom, sauntered about among the mixed population of"
Chapter 9,"Somalis, Banyans, Parsees, Jews, Arabs, and Europeans who comprise the"
Chapter 9,twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden. He gazed with wonder upon the
Chapter 9,"fortifications which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian Ocean,"
Chapter 9,"and the vast cisterns where the English engineers were still at work,"
Chapter 9,two thousand years after the engineers of Solomon.
Chapter 9,"“Very curious, _very_ curious,” said Passepartout to himself, on"
Chapter 9,returning to the steamer. “I see that it is by no means useless to
Chapter 9,"travel, if a man wants to see something new.” At six p.m. the"
Chapter 9,"“Mongolia” slowly moved out of the roadstead, and was soon once more on"
Chapter 9,the Indian Ocean. She had a hundred and sixty-eight hours in which to
Chapter 9,"reach Bombay, and the sea was favourable, the wind being in the"
Chapter 9,"north-west, and all sails aiding the engine. The steamer rolled but"
Chapter 9,"little, the ladies, in fresh toilets, reappeared on deck, and the"
Chapter 9,singing and dancing were resumed. The trip was being accomplished most
Chapter 9,"successfully, and Passepartout was enchanted with the congenial"
Chapter 9,companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful
Chapter 9,"Fix. On Sunday, October 20th, towards noon, they came in sight of the"
Chapter 9,Indian coast: two hours later the pilot came on board. A range of hills
Chapter 9,"lay against the sky in the horizon, and soon the rows of palms which"
Chapter 9,adorn Bombay came distinctly into view. The steamer entered the road
Chapter 9,"formed by the islands in the bay, and at half-past four she hauled up"
Chapter 9,at the quays of Bombay.
Chapter 9,Phileas Fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty-third rubber of the
Chapter 9,"voyage, and his partner and himself having, by a bold stroke, captured"
Chapter 9,"all thirteen of the tricks, concluded this fine campaign with a"
Chapter 9,brilliant victory.
Chapter 9,The “Mongolia” was due at Bombay on the 22nd; she arrived on the 20th.
Chapter 9,This was a gain to Phileas Fogg of two days since his departure from
Chapter 9,"London, and he calmly entered the fact in the itinerary, in the column"
Chapter 9,of gains.
Chapter 10,CHAPTER X.
Chapter 10,IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT IS ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET OFF WITH THE LOSS OF HIS
Chapter 10,SHOES
Chapter 10,"Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land, with its base"
Chapter 10,"in the north and its apex in the south, which is called India, embraces"
Chapter 10,"fourteen hundred thousand square miles, upon which is spread unequally"
Chapter 10,a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls. The British
Chapter 10,Crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of
Chapter 10,"this vast country, and has a governor-general stationed at Calcutta,"
Chapter 10,"governors at Madras, Bombay, and in Bengal, and a lieutenant-governor"
Chapter 10,at Agra.
Chapter 10,"But British India, properly so called, only embraces seven hundred"
Chapter 10,"thousand square miles, and a population of from one hundred to one"
Chapter 10,hundred and ten millions of inhabitants. A considerable portion of
Chapter 10,India is still free from British authority; and there are certain
Chapter 10,ferocious rajahs in the interior who are absolutely independent. The
Chapter 10,"celebrated East India Company was all-powerful from 1756, when the"
Chapter 10,English first gained a foothold on the spot where now stands the city
Chapter 10,"of Madras, down to the time of the great Sepoy insurrection. It"
Chapter 10,"gradually annexed province after province, purchasing them of the"
Chapter 10,"native chiefs, whom it seldom paid, and appointed the governor-general"
Chapter 10,"and his subordinates, civil and military. But the East India Company"
Chapter 10,"has now passed away, leaving the British possessions in India directly"
Chapter 10,"under the control of the Crown. The aspect of the country, as well as"
Chapter 10,"the manners and distinctions of race, is daily changing."
Chapter 10,Formerly one was obliged to travel in India by the old cumbrous methods
Chapter 10,"of going on foot or on horseback, in palanquins or unwieldy coaches;"
Chapter 10,"now fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the Ganges, and a great"
Chapter 10,"railway, with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its"
Chapter 10,"route, traverses the peninsula from Bombay to Calcutta in three days."
Chapter 10,This railway does not run in a direct line across India. The distance
Chapter 10,"between Bombay and Calcutta, as the bird flies, is only from one"
Chapter 10,thousand to eleven hundred miles; but the deflections of the road
Chapter 10,increase this distance by more than a third.
Chapter 10,The general route of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is as follows:
Chapter 10,"Leaving Bombay, it passes through Salcette, crossing to the continent"
Chapter 10,"opposite Tannah, goes over the chain of the Western Ghauts, runs thence"
Chapter 10,"north-east as far as Burhampoor, skirts the nearly independent"
Chapter 10,"territory of Bundelcund, ascends to Allahabad, turns thence eastwardly,"
Chapter 10,"meeting the Ganges at Benares, then departs from the river a little,"
Chapter 10,"and, descending south-eastward by Burdivan and the French town of"
Chapter 10,"Chandernagor, has its terminus at Calcutta."
Chapter 10,The passengers of the “Mongolia” went ashore at half-past four p.m.; at
Chapter 10,exactly eight the train would start for Calcutta.
Chapter 10,"Mr. Fogg, after bidding good-bye to his whist partners, left the"
Chapter 10,"steamer, gave his servant several errands to do, urged it upon him to"
Chapter 10,"be at the station promptly at eight, and, with his regular step, which"
Chapter 10,"beat to the second, like an astronomical clock, directed his steps to"
Chapter 10,"the passport office. As for the wonders of Bombay—its famous city hall,"
Chapter 10,"its splendid library, its forts and docks, its bazaars, mosques,"
Chapter 10,"synagogues, its Armenian churches, and the noble pagoda on Malabar"
Chapter 10,"Hill, with its two polygonal towers—he cared not a straw to see them."
Chapter 10,"He would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of Elephanta, or"
Chapter 10,"the mysterious hypogea, concealed south-east from the docks, or those"
Chapter 10,"fine remains of Buddhist architecture, the Kanherian grottoes of the"
Chapter 10,island of Salcette.
Chapter 10,"Having transacted his business at the passport office, Phileas Fogg"
Chapter 10,"repaired quietly to the railway station, where he ordered dinner. Among"
Chapter 10,"the dishes served up to him, the landlord especially recommended a"
Chapter 10,"certain giblet of “native rabbit,” on which he prided himself."
Chapter 10,"Mr. Fogg accordingly tasted the dish, but, despite its spiced sauce,"
Chapter 10,"found it far from palatable. He rang for the landlord, and, on his"
Chapter 10,"appearance, said, fixing his clear eyes upon him, “Is this rabbit,"
Chapter 10,sir?”
Chapter 10,"“Yes, my lord,” the rogue boldly replied, “rabbit from the jungles.”"
Chapter 10,“And this rabbit did not mew when he was killed?”
Chapter 10,"“Mew, my lord! What, a rabbit mew! I swear to you—”"
Chapter 10,"“Be so good, landlord, as not to swear, but remember this: cats were"
Chapter 10,"formerly considered, in India, as sacred animals. That was a good"
Chapter 10,time.”
Chapter 10,"“For the cats, my lord?”"
Chapter 10,“Perhaps for the travellers as well!”
Chapter 10,After which Mr. Fogg quietly continued his dinner. Fix had gone on
Chapter 10,"shore shortly after Mr. Fogg, and his first destination was the"
Chapter 10,headquarters of the Bombay police. He made himself known as a London
Chapter 10,"detective, told his business at Bombay, and the position of affairs"
Chapter 10,"relative to the supposed robber, and nervously asked if a warrant had"
Chapter 10,"arrived from London. It had not reached the office; indeed, there had"
Chapter 10,"not yet been time for it to arrive. Fix was sorely disappointed, and"
Chapter 10,tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay
Chapter 10,"police. This the director refused, as the matter concerned the London"
Chapter 10,"office, which alone could legally deliver the warrant. Fix did not"
Chapter 10,"insist, and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the"
Chapter 10,important document; but he was determined not to lose sight of the
Chapter 10,mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in Bombay. He did not doubt for a
Chapter 10,"moment, any more than Passepartout, that Phileas Fogg would remain"
Chapter 10,"there, at least until it was time for the warrant to arrive."
Chapter 10,"Passepartout, however, had no sooner heard his master’s orders on"
Chapter 10,leaving the “Mongolia” than he saw at once that they were to leave
Chapter 10,"Bombay as they had done Suez and Paris, and that the journey would be"
Chapter 10,"extended at least as far as Calcutta, and perhaps beyond that place. He"
Chapter 10,began to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg talked about was not
Chapter 10,"really in good earnest, and whether his fate was not in truth forcing"
Chapter 10,"him, despite his love of repose, around the world in eighty days!"
Chapter 10,"Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes, he took a"
Chapter 10,"leisurely promenade about the streets, where crowds of people of many"
Chapter 10,"nationalities—Europeans, Persians with pointed caps, Banyas with round"
Chapter 10,"turbans, Sindes with square bonnets, Parsees with black mitres, and"
Chapter 10,long-robed Armenians—were collected. It happened to be the day of a
Chapter 10,Parsee festival. These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster—the most
Chapter 10,"thrifty, civilised, intelligent, and austere of the East Indians, among"
Chapter 10,whom are counted the richest native merchants of Bombay—were
Chapter 10,"celebrating a sort of religious carnival, with processions and shows,"
Chapter 10,"in the midst of which Indian dancing-girls, clothed in rose-coloured"
Chapter 10,"gauze, looped up with gold and silver, danced airily, but with perfect"
Chapter 10,"modesty, to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines. It is"
Chapter 10,needless to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with
Chapter 10,"staring eyes and gaping mouth, and that his countenance was that of the"
Chapter 10,greenest booby imaginable.
Chapter 10,"Unhappily for his master, as well as himself, his curiosity drew him"
Chapter 10,"unconsciously farther off than he intended to go. At last, having seen"
Chapter 10,"the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance, he was turning his steps"
Chapter 10,"towards the station, when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on"
Chapter 10,"Malabar Hill, and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its"
Chapter 10,interior. He was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to
Chapter 10,"enter certain Indian temples, and that even the faithful must not go in"
Chapter 10,without first leaving their shoes outside the door. It may be said here
Chapter 10,that the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a
Chapter 10,disregard of the practices of the native religions.
Chapter 10,"Passepartout, however, thinking no harm, went in like a simple tourist,"
Chapter 10,and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation
Chapter 10,"which everywhere met his eyes, when of a sudden he found himself"
Chapter 10,sprawling on the sacred flagging. He looked up to behold three enraged
Chapter 10,"priests, who forthwith fell upon him; tore off his shoes, and began to"
Chapter 10,"beat him with loud, savage exclamations. The agile Frenchman was soon"
Chapter 10,"upon his feet again, and lost no time in knocking down two of his"
Chapter 10,long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of
Chapter 10,"his toes; then, rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could"
Chapter 10,"carry him, he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd"
Chapter 10,in the streets.
Chapter 10,"At five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, shoeless, and"
Chapter 10,"having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes, rushed"
Chapter 10,breathlessly into the station.
Chapter 10,"Fix, who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station, and saw that he was"
Chapter 10,"really going to leave Bombay, was there, upon the platform. He had"
Chapter 10,"resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta, and farther, if"
Chapter 10,"necessary. Passepartout did not observe the detective, who stood in an"
Chapter 10,obscure corner; but Fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words
Chapter 10,to Mr. Fogg.
Chapter 10,"“I hope that this will not happen again,” said Phileas Fogg coldly, as"
Chapter 10,"he got into the train. Poor Passepartout, quite crestfallen, followed"
Chapter 10,his master without a word. Fix was on the point of entering another
Chapter 10,"carriage, when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan."
Chapter 10,"“No, I’ll stay,” muttered he. “An offence has been committed on Indian"
Chapter 10,soil. I’ve got my man.”
Chapter 10,"Just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech, and the train passed out"
Chapter 10,into the darkness of the night.
Chapter 11,CHAPTER XI.
Chapter 11,IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SECURES A CURIOUS MEANS OF CONVEYANCE AT A
Chapter 11,FABULOUS PRICE
Chapter 11,The train had started punctually. Among the passengers were a number of
Chapter 11,"officers, Government officials, and opium and indigo merchants, whose"
Chapter 11,business called them to the eastern coast. Passepartout rode in the
Chapter 11,"same carriage with his master, and a third passenger occupied a seat"
Chapter 11,"opposite to them. This was Sir Francis Cromarty, one of Mr. Fogg’s"
Chapter 11,"whist partners on the “Mongolia,” now on his way to join his corps at"
Chapter 11,"Benares. Sir Francis was a tall, fair man of fifty, who had greatly"
Chapter 11,"distinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt. He made India his home,"
Chapter 11,only paying brief visits to England at rare intervals; and was almost
Chapter 11,"as familiar as a native with the customs, history, and character of"
Chapter 11,"India and its people. But Phileas Fogg, who was not travelling, but"
Chapter 11,"only describing a circumference, took no pains to inquire into these"
Chapter 11,"subjects; he was a solid body, traversing an orbit around the"
Chapter 11,"terrestrial globe, according to the laws of rational mechanics. He was"
Chapter 11,at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since
Chapter 11,"his departure from London, and, had it been in his nature to make a"
Chapter 11,"useless demonstration, would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction."
Chapter 11,Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling
Chapter 11,companion—although the only opportunity he had for studying him had
Chapter 11,"been while he was dealing the cards, and between two rubbers—and"
Chapter 11,questioned himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold
Chapter 11,"exterior, and whether Phileas Fogg had any sense of the beauties of"
Chapter 11,"nature. The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that, of all"
Chapter 11,"the eccentric persons he had ever met, none was comparable to this"
Chapter 11,product of the exact sciences.
Chapter 11,Phileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of going
Chapter 11,"round the world, nor the circumstances under which he set out; and the"
Chapter 11,general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of
Chapter 11,"sound common sense. In the way this strange gentleman was going on, he"
Chapter 11,would leave the world without having done any good to himself or
Chapter 11,anybody else.
Chapter 11,An hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed the viaducts and the
Chapter 11,"Island of Salcette, and had got into the open country. At Callyan they"
Chapter 11,reached the junction of the branch line which descends towards
Chapter 11,"south-eastern India by Kandallah and Pounah; and, passing Pauwell, they"
Chapter 11,"entered the defiles of the mountains, with their basalt bases, and"
Chapter 11,their summits crowned with thick and verdant forests. Phileas Fogg and
Chapter 11,"Sir Francis Cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time, and now"
Chapter 11,"Sir Francis, reviving the conversation, observed, “Some years ago, Mr."
Chapter 11,"Fogg, you would have met with a delay at this point which would"
Chapter 11,probably have lost you your wager.”
Chapter 11,"“How so, Sir Francis?”"
Chapter 11,"“Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains, which the"
Chapter 11,passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to
Chapter 11,"Kandallah, on the other side.”"
Chapter 11,"“Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least,” said Mr."
Chapter 11,Fogg. “I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles.”
Chapter 11,"“But, Mr. Fogg,” pursued Sir Francis, “you run the risk of having some"
Chapter 11,difficulty about this worthy fellow’s adventure at the pagoda.”
Chapter 11,"Passepartout, his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket,"
Chapter 11,was sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him.
Chapter 11,“The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence. It takes
Chapter 11,particular care that the religious customs of the Indians should be
Chapter 11,"respected, and if your servant were caught—”"
Chapter 11,"“Very well, Sir Francis,” replied Mr. Fogg; “if he had been caught he"
Chapter 11,"would have been condemned and punished, and then would have quietly"
Chapter 11,returned to Europe. I don’t see how this affair could have delayed his
Chapter 11,master.”
Chapter 11,The conversation fell again. During the night the train left the
Chapter 11,"mountains behind, and passed Nassik, and the next day proceeded over"
Chapter 11,"the flat, well-cultivated country of the Khandeish, with its straggling"
Chapter 11,"villages, above which rose the minarets of the pagodas. This fertile"
Chapter 11,"territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams,"
Chapter 11,mostly tributaries of the Godavery.
Chapter 11,"Passepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise that he was"
Chapter 11,"actually crossing India in a railway train. The locomotive, guided by"
Chapter 11,"an English engineer and fed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon"
Chapter 11,"cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, while the steam"
Chapter 11,"curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which"
Chapter 11,"were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort of abandoned"
Chapter 11,"monasteries), and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless"
Chapter 11,ornamentation of Indian architecture. Then they came upon vast tracts
Chapter 11,"extending to the horizon, with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers,"
Chapter 11,which fled at the noise of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated
Chapter 11,"by the railway, and still haunted by elephants which, with pensive"
Chapter 11,"eyes, gazed at the train as it passed. The travellers crossed, beyond"
Chapter 11,"Milligaum, the fatal country so often stained with blood by the"
Chapter 11,"sectaries of the goddess Kali. Not far off rose Ellora, with its"
Chapter 11,"graceful pagodas, and the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious"
Chapter 11,"Aureng-Zeb, now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the"
Chapter 11,"kingdom of the Nizam. It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the Thuggee"
Chapter 11,"chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway. These ruffians, united by"
Chapter 11,"a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess"
Chapter 11,"Death, without ever shedding blood; there was a period when this part"
Chapter 11,of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being
Chapter 11,found in every direction. The English Government has succeeded in
Chapter 11,"greatly diminishing these murders, though the Thuggees still exist, and"
Chapter 11,pursue the exercise of their horrible rites.
Chapter 11,At half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout
Chapter 11,"was able to purchase some Indian slippers, ornamented with false"
Chapter 11,"pearls, in which, with evident vanity, he proceeded to encase his feet."
Chapter 11,"The travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for Assurghur,"
Chapter 11,"after skirting for a little the banks of the small river Tapty, which"
Chapter 11,"empties into the Gulf of Cambray, near Surat."
Chapter 11,Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie. Up to his arrival
Chapter 11,"at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there;"
Chapter 11,"but, now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed, a"
Chapter 11,sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams. His old vagabond
Chapter 11,nature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took
Chapter 11,possession of him. He came to regard his master’s project as intended
Chapter 11,"in good earnest, believed in the reality of the bet, and therefore in"
Chapter 11,the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail
Chapter 11,within the designated period. Already he began to worry about possible
Chapter 11,"delays, and accidents which might happen on the way. He recognised"
Chapter 11,"himself as being personally interested in the wager, and trembled at"
Chapter 11,the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his
Chapter 11,unpardonable folly of the night before. Being much less cool-headed
Chapter 11,"than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the"
Chapter 11,"days passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and"
Chapter 11,"accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not"
Chapter 11,"having bribed the engineer. The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while"
Chapter 11,"it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could"
Chapter 11,not be done on the railway.
Chapter 11,"The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate"
Chapter 11,"the Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening. The next day Sir"
Chapter 11,"Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to which, on"
Chapter 11,"consulting his watch, he replied that it was three in the morning. This"
Chapter 11,"famous timepiece, always regulated on the Greenwich meridian, which was"
Chapter 11,"now some seventy-seven degrees westward, was at least four hours slow."
Chapter 11,"Sir Francis corrected Passepartout’s time, whereupon the latter made"
Chapter 11,the same remark that he had done to Fix; and upon the general insisting
Chapter 11,"that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian, since he was"
Chapter 11,"constantly going eastward, that is in the face of the sun, and"
Chapter 11,therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone
Chapter 11,"over, Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch, which he"
Chapter 11,kept at London time. It was an innocent delusion which could harm no
Chapter 11,one.
Chapter 11,"The train stopped, at eight o’clock, in the midst of a glade some"
Chapter 11,"fifteen miles beyond Rothal, where there were several bungalows, and"
Chapter 11,"workmen’s cabins. The conductor, passing along the carriages, shouted,"
Chapter 11,“Passengers will get out here!”
Chapter 11,Phileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation; but the
Chapter 11,general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of
Chapter 11,dates and acacias.
Chapter 11,"Passepartout, not less surprised, rushed out and speedily returned,"
Chapter 11,"crying: “Monsieur, no more railway!”"
Chapter 11,“What do you mean?” asked Sir Francis.
Chapter 11,“I mean to say that the train isn’t going on.”
Chapter 11,"The general at once stepped out, while Phileas Fogg calmly followed"
Chapter 11,"him, and they proceeded together to the conductor."
Chapter 11,“Where are we?” asked Sir Francis.
Chapter 11,“At the hamlet of Kholby.”
Chapter 11,“Do we stop here?”
Chapter 11,“Certainly. The railway isn’t finished.”
Chapter 11,“What! not finished?”
Chapter 11,“No. There’s still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to
Chapter 11,"Allahabad, where the line begins again.”"
Chapter 11,“But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout.”
Chapter 11,"“What would you have, officer? The papers were mistaken.”"
Chapter 11,"“Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta,” retorted Sir Francis,"
Chapter 11,who was growing warm.
Chapter 11,"“No doubt,” replied the conductor; “but the passengers know that they"
Chapter 11,must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to
Chapter 11,Allahabad.”
Chapter 11,Sir Francis was furious. Passepartout would willingly have knocked the
Chapter 11,"conductor down, and did not dare to look at his master."
Chapter 11,"“Sir Francis,” said Mr. Fogg quietly, “we will, if you please, look"
Chapter 11,about for some means of conveyance to Allahabad.”
Chapter 11,"“Mr. Fogg, this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage.”"
Chapter 11,"“No, Sir Francis; it was foreseen.”"
Chapter 11,“What! You knew that the way—”
Chapter 11,“Not at all; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or
Chapter 11,"later arise on my route. Nothing, therefore, is lost. I have two days,"
Chapter 11,"which I have already gained, to sacrifice. A steamer leaves Calcutta"
Chapter 11,"for Hong Kong at noon, on the 25th. This is the 22nd, and we shall"
Chapter 11,reach Calcutta in time.”
Chapter 11,There was nothing to say to so confident a response.
Chapter 11,It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this
Chapter 11,"point. The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting"
Chapter 11,"too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the"
Chapter 11,completion of the line. The greater part of the travellers were aware
Chapter 11,"of this interruption, and, leaving the train, they began to engage such"
Chapter 11,"vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis, waggons"
Chapter 11,"drawn by zebus, carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas,"
Chapter 11,"palanquins, ponies, and what not."
Chapter 11,"Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, after searching the village from end"
Chapter 11,"to end, came back without having found anything."
Chapter 11,"“I shall go afoot,” said Phileas Fogg."
Chapter 11,"Passepartout, who had now rejoined his master, made a wry grimace, as"
Chapter 11,"he thought of his magnificent, but too frail Indian shoes. Happily he"
Chapter 11,"too had been looking about him, and, after a moment’s hesitation, said,"
Chapter 11,"“Monsieur, I think I have found a means of conveyance.”"
Chapter 11,“What?”
Chapter 11,“An elephant! An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a
Chapter 11,hundred steps from here.”
Chapter 11,"“Let’s go and see the elephant,” replied Mr. Fogg."
Chapter 11,"They soon reached a small hut, near which, enclosed within some high"
Chapter 11,"palings, was the animal in question. An Indian came out of the hut,"
Chapter 11,"and, at their request, conducted them within the enclosure. The"
Chapter 11,"elephant, which its owner had reared, not for a beast of burden, but"
Chapter 11,"for warlike purposes, was half domesticated. The Indian had begun"
Chapter 11,"already, by often irritating him, and feeding him every three months on"
Chapter 11,"sugar and butter, to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature, this"
Chapter 11,method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for
Chapter 11,"battle. Happily, however, for Mr. Fogg, the animal’s instruction in"
Chapter 11,"this direction had not gone far, and the elephant still preserved his"
Chapter 11,natural gentleness. Kiouni—this was the name of the beast—could
Chapter 11,"doubtless travel rapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other"
Chapter 11,"means of conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him. But elephants are"
Chapter 11,"far from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce, the males,"
Chapter 11,"which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought, especially"
Chapter 11,as but few of them are domesticated. When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed
Chapter 11,"to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank. Mr. Fogg"
Chapter 11,"persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the"
Chapter 11,loan of the beast to Allahabad. Refused. Twenty pounds? Refused also.
Chapter 11,Forty pounds? Still refused. Passepartout jumped at each advance; but
Chapter 11,"the Indian declined to be tempted. Yet the offer was an alluring one,"
Chapter 11,"for, supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach Allahabad,"
Chapter 11,his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling.
Chapter 11,"Phileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then proposed to"
Chapter 11,"purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds"
Chapter 11,"for him. The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great"
Chapter 11,"bargain, still refused."
Chapter 11,"Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect"
Chapter 11,before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was
Chapter 11,"not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds"
Chapter 11,"was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him, and"
Chapter 11,that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value.
Chapter 11,"Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with"
Chapter 11,"avarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a"
Chapter 11,"price he could obtain. Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then"
Chapter 11,"fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds. Passepartout,"
Chapter 11,"usually so rubicund, was fairly white with suspense."
Chapter 11,At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded.
Chapter 11,"“What a price, good heavens!” cried Passepartout, “for an elephant.”"
Chapter 11,"It only remained now to find a guide, which was comparatively easy. A"
Chapter 11,"young Parsee, with an intelligent face, offered his services, which Mr."
Chapter 11,"Fogg accepted, promising so generous a reward as to materially"
Chapter 11,"stimulate his zeal. The elephant was led out and equipped. The Parsee,"
Chapter 11,"who was an accomplished elephant driver, covered his back with a sort"
Chapter 11,"of saddle-cloth, and attached to each of his flanks some curiously"
Chapter 11,uncomfortable howdahs. Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with some banknotes
Chapter 11,"which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag, a proceeding that seemed"
Chapter 11,to deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals. Then he offered to carry
Chapter 11,"Sir Francis to Allahabad, which the brigadier gratefully accepted, as"
Chapter 11,one traveller the more would not be likely to fatigue the gigantic
Chapter 11,"beast. Provisions were purchased at Kholby, and, while Sir Francis and"
Chapter 11,"Mr. Fogg took the howdahs on either side, Passepartout got astride the"
Chapter 11,saddle-cloth between them. The Parsee perched himself on the elephant’s
Chapter 11,"neck, and at nine o’clock they set out from the village, the animal"
Chapter 11,marching off through the dense forest of palms by the shortest cut.
Chapter 12,CHAPTER XII.
Chapter 12,IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND HIS COMPANIONS VENTURE ACROSS THE INDIAN
Chapter 12,"FORESTS, AND WHAT ENSUED"
Chapter 12,"In order to shorten the journey, the guide passed to the left of the"
Chapter 12,"line where the railway was still in process of being built. This line,"
Chapter 12,"owing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia Mountains, did not"
Chapter 12,"pursue a straight course. The Parsee, who was quite familiar with the"
Chapter 12,"roads and paths in the district, declared that they would gain twenty"
Chapter 12,miles by striking directly through the forest.
Chapter 12,"Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, plunged to the neck in the"
Chapter 12,"peculiar howdahs provided for them, were horribly jostled by the swift"
Chapter 12,"trotting of the elephant, spurred on as he was by the skilful Parsee;"
Chapter 12,"but they endured the discomfort with true British phlegm, talking"
Chapter 12,"little, and scarcely able to catch a glimpse of each other. As for"
Chapter 12,"Passepartout, who was mounted on the beast’s back, and received the"
Chapter 12,"direct force of each concussion as he trod along, he was very careful,"
Chapter 12,"in accordance with his master’s advice, to keep his tongue from between"
Chapter 12,"his teeth, as it would otherwise have been bitten off short. The worthy"
Chapter 12,"fellow bounced from the elephant’s neck to his rump, and vaulted like a"
Chapter 12,"clown on a spring-board; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing,"
Chapter 12,"and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket, and"
Chapter 12,"inserted it in Kiouni’s trunk, who received it without in the least"
Chapter 12,slackening his regular trot.
Chapter 12,"After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave him an hour"
Chapter 12,"for rest, during which Kiouni, after quenching his thirst at a"
Chapter 12,"neighbouring spring, set to devouring the branches and shrubs round"
Chapter 12,"about him. Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay, and"
Chapter 12,"both descended with a feeling of relief. “Why, he’s made of iron!”"
Chapter 12,"exclaimed the general, gazing admiringly on Kiouni."
Chapter 12,"“Of forged iron,” replied Passepartout, as he set about preparing a"
Chapter 12,hasty breakfast.
Chapter 12,At noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure. The country soon
Chapter 12,presented a very savage aspect. Copses of dates and dwarf-palms
Chapter 12,"succeeded the dense forests; then vast, dry plains, dotted with scanty"
Chapter 12,"shrubs, and sown with great blocks of syenite. All this portion of"
Chapter 12,"Bundelcund, which is little frequented by travellers, is inhabited by a"
Chapter 12,"fanatical population, hardened in the most horrible practices of the"
Chapter 12,Hindoo faith. The English have not been able to secure complete
Chapter 12,"dominion over this territory, which is subjected to the influence of"
Chapter 12,"rajahs, whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible"
Chapter 12,mountain fastnesses. The travellers several times saw bands of
Chapter 12,"ferocious Indians, who, when they perceived the elephant striding"
Chapter 12,"across-country, made angry and threatening motions. The Parsee avoided"
Chapter 12,them as much as possible. Few animals were observed on the route; even
Chapter 12,the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which
Chapter 12,convulsed Passepartout with laughter.
Chapter 12,"In the midst of his gaiety, however, one thought troubled the worthy"
Chapter 12,servant. What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he got to
Chapter 12,Allahabad? Would he carry him on with him? Impossible! The cost of
Chapter 12,"transporting him would make him ruinously expensive. Would he sell him,"
Chapter 12,or set him free? The estimable beast certainly deserved some
Chapter 12,"consideration. Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him, Passepartout, a"
Chapter 12,"present of Kiouni, he would be very much embarrassed; and these"
Chapter 12,thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time.
Chapter 12,The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the
Chapter 12,"evening, and another halt was made on the northern slope, in a ruined"
Chapter 12,"bungalow. They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day, and an equal"
Chapter 12,distance still separated them from the station of Allahabad.
Chapter 12,The night was cold. The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few
Chapter 12,"dry branches, and the warmth was very grateful, provisions purchased at"
Chapter 12,"Kholby sufficed for supper, and the travellers ate ravenously. The"
Chapter 12,"conversation, beginning with a few disconnected phrases, soon gave"
Chapter 12,"place to loud and steady snores. The guide watched Kiouni, who slept"
Chapter 12,"standing, bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree. Nothing"
Chapter 12,"occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers, although"
Chapter 12,occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the
Chapter 12,silence; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile
Chapter 12,demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow. Sir Francis slept
Chapter 12,"heavily, like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue. Passepartout was"
Chapter 12,wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before. As for Mr.
Chapter 12,"Fogg, he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene"
Chapter 12,mansion in Saville Row.
Chapter 12,The journey was resumed at six in the morning; the guide hoped to reach
Chapter 12,"Allahabad by evening. In that case, Mr. Fogg would only lose a part of"
Chapter 12,"the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour. Kiouni,"
Chapter 12,"resuming his rapid gait, soon descended the lower spurs of the"
Chapter 12,"Vindhias, and towards noon they passed by the village of Kallenger, on"
Chapter 12,"the Cani, one of the branches of the Ganges. The guide avoided"
Chapter 12,"inhabited places, thinking it safer to keep the open country, which"
Chapter 12,lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river.
Chapter 12,Allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north-east. They stopped
Chapter 12,"under a clump of bananas, the fruit of which, as healthy as bread and"
Chapter 12,"as succulent as cream, was amply partaken of and appreciated."
Chapter 12,At two o’clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several
Chapter 12,miles; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods. They had not as
Chapter 12,"yet had any unpleasant encounters, and the journey seemed on the point"
Chapter 12,"of being successfully accomplished, when the elephant, becoming"
Chapter 12,"restless, suddenly stopped."
Chapter 12,It was then four o’clock.
Chapter 12,"“What’s the matter?” asked Sir Francis, putting out his head."
Chapter 12,"“I don’t know, officer,” replied the Parsee, listening attentively to a"
Chapter 12,confused murmur which came through the thick branches.
Chapter 12,The murmur soon became more distinct; it now seemed like a distant
Chapter 12,concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments. Passepartout
Chapter 12,was all eyes and ears. Mr. Fogg patiently waited without a word. The
Chapter 12,"Parsee jumped to the ground, fastened the elephant to a tree, and"
Chapter 12,"plunged into the thicket. He soon returned, saying:"
Chapter 12,“A procession of Brahmins is coming this way. We must prevent their
Chapter 12,"seeing us, if possible.”"
Chapter 12,"The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket, at the same"
Chapter 12,time asking the travellers not to stir. He held himself ready to
Chapter 12,"bestride the animal at a moment’s notice, should flight become"
Chapter 12,necessary; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful
Chapter 12,"would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage, in which"
Chapter 12,they were wholly concealed.
Chapter 12,"The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer, and now"
Chapter 12,droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals.
Chapter 12,"The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees, a hundred"
Chapter 12,paces away; and the strange figures who performed the religious
Chapter 12,ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches. First came the
Chapter 12,"priests, with mitres on their heads, and clothed in long lace robes."
Chapter 12,"They were surrounded by men, women, and children, who sang a kind of"
Chapter 12,"lugubrious psalm, interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines"
Chapter 12,"and cymbals; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels, the"
Chapter 12,spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each other. Upon the
Chapter 12,"car, which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus, stood a hideous"
Chapter 12,"statue with four arms, the body coloured a dull red, with haggard eyes,"
Chapter 12,"dishevelled hair, protruding tongue, and lips tinted with betel. It"
Chapter 12,stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and headless giant.
Chapter 12,"Sir Francis, recognising the statue, whispered, “The goddess Kali; the"
Chapter 12,goddess of love and death.”
Chapter 12,"“Of death, perhaps,” muttered back Passepartout, “but of love—that ugly"
Chapter 12,old hag? Never!”
Chapter 12,The Parsee made a motion to keep silence.
Chapter 12,A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the
Chapter 12,"statue; these were striped with ochre, and covered with cuts whence"
Chapter 12,"their blood issued drop by drop—stupid fanatics, who, in the great"
Chapter 12,"Indian ceremonies, still throw themselves under the wheels of"
Chapter 12,"Juggernaut. Some Brahmins, clad in all the sumptuousness of Oriental"
Chapter 12,"apparel, and leading a woman who faltered at every step, followed. This"
Chapter 12,"woman was young, and as fair as a European. Her head and neck,"
Chapter 12,"shoulders, ears, arms, hands, and toes were loaded down with jewels and"
Chapter 12,"gems with bracelets, earrings, and rings; while a tunic bordered with"
Chapter 12,"gold, and covered with a light muslin robe, betrayed the outline of her"
Chapter 12,form.
Chapter 12,The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to
Chapter 12,"her, armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists, and"
Chapter 12,"long damascened pistols, and bearing a corpse on a palanquin. It was"
Chapter 12,"the body of an old man, gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a"
Chapter 12,"rajah, wearing, as in life, a turban embroidered with pearls, a robe of"
Chapter 12,"tissue of silk and gold, a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds, and"
Chapter 12,the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince. Next came the musicians and
Chapter 12,"a rearguard of capering fakirs, whose cries sometimes drowned the noise"
Chapter 12,of the instruments; these closed the procession.
Chapter 12,"Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance, and, turning"
Chapter 12,"to the guide, said, “A suttee.”"
Chapter 12,"The Parsee nodded, and put his finger to his lips. The procession"
Chapter 12,"slowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared in"
Chapter 12,the depths of the wood. The songs gradually died away; occasionally
Chapter 12,"cries were heard in the distance, until at last all was silence again."
Chapter 12,"Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said, and, as soon as the"
Chapter 12,"procession had disappeared, asked: “What is a suttee?”"
Chapter 12,"“A suttee,” returned the general, “is a human sacrifice, but a"
Chapter 12,voluntary one. The woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow at
Chapter 12,the dawn of day.”
Chapter 12,"“Oh, the scoundrels!” cried Passepartout, who could not repress his"
Chapter 12,indignation.
Chapter 12,“And the corpse?” asked Mr. Fogg.
Chapter 12,"“Is that of the prince, her husband,” said the guide; “an independent"
Chapter 12,rajah of Bundelcund.”
Chapter 12,"“Is it possible,” resumed Phileas Fogg, his voice betraying not the"
Chapter 12,"least emotion, “that these barbarous customs still exist in India, and"
Chapter 12,that the English have been unable to put a stop to them?”
Chapter 12,"“These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India,” replied"
Chapter 12,"Sir Francis; “but we have no power over these savage territories, and"
Chapter 12,especially here in Bundelcund. The whole district north of the Vindhias
Chapter 12,is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage.”
Chapter 12,"“The poor wretch!” exclaimed Passepartout, “to be burned alive!”"
Chapter 12,"“Yes,” returned Sir Francis, “burned alive. And, if she were not, you"
Chapter 12,cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from
Chapter 12,"her relatives. They would shave off her hair, feed her on a scanty"
Chapter 12,"allowance of rice, treat her with contempt; she would be looked upon as"
Chapter 12,"an unclean creature, and would die in some corner, like a scurvy dog."
Chapter 12,The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures
Chapter 12,to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism.
Chapter 12,"Sometimes, however, the sacrifice is really voluntary, and it requires"
Chapter 12,the active interference of the Government to prevent it. Several years
Chapter 12,"ago, when I was living at Bombay, a young widow asked permission of the"
Chapter 12,"governor to be burned along with her husband’s body; but, as you may"
Chapter 12,"imagine, he refused. The woman left the town, took refuge with an"
Chapter 12,"independent rajah, and there carried out her self-devoted purpose.”"
Chapter 12,"While Sir Francis was speaking, the guide shook his head several times,"
Chapter 12,and now said: “The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is
Chapter 12,not a voluntary one.”
Chapter 12,“How do you know?”
Chapter 12,“Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund.”
Chapter 12,"“But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance,”"
Chapter 12,observed Sir Francis.
Chapter 12,“That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and
Chapter 12,opium.”
Chapter 12,“But where are they taking her?”
Chapter 12,"“To the pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here; she will pass the night"
Chapter 12,there.”
Chapter 12,“And the sacrifice will take place—”
Chapter 12,"“To-morrow, at the first light of dawn.”"
Chapter 12,"The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket, and leaped upon his"
Chapter 12,neck. Just at the moment that he was about to urge Kiouni forward with
Chapter 12,"a peculiar whistle, Mr. Fogg stopped him, and, turning to Sir Francis"
Chapter 12,"Cromarty, said, “Suppose we save this woman.”"
Chapter 12,"“Save the woman, Mr. Fogg!”"
Chapter 12,“I have yet twelve hours to spare; I can devote them to that.”
Chapter 12,"“Why, you are a man of heart!”"
Chapter 12,"“Sometimes,” replied Phileas Fogg, quietly; “when I have the time.”"
Chapter 13,CHAPTER XIII.
Chapter 13,IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT RECEIVES A NEW PROOF THAT FORTUNE FAVORS THE
Chapter 13,BRAVE
Chapter 13,"The project was a bold one, full of difficulty, perhaps impracticable."
Chapter 13,"Mr. Fogg was going to risk life, or at least liberty, and therefore the"
Chapter 13,"success of his tour. But he did not hesitate, and he found in Sir"
Chapter 13,Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic ally.
Chapter 13,"As for Passepartout, he was ready for anything that might be proposed."
Chapter 13,"His master’s idea charmed him; he perceived a heart, a soul, under that"
Chapter 13,icy exterior. He began to love Phileas Fogg.
Chapter 13,There remained the guide: what course would he adopt? Would he not take
Chapter 13,"part with the Indians? In default of his assistance, it was necessary"
Chapter 13,to be assured of his neutrality.
Chapter 13,Sir Francis frankly put the question to him.
Chapter 13,"“Officers,” replied the guide, “I am a Parsee, and this woman is a"
Chapter 13,Parsee. Command me as you will.”
Chapter 13,“Excellent!” said Mr. Fogg.
Chapter 13,"“However,” resumed the guide, “it is certain, not only that we shall"
Chapter 13,"risk our lives, but horrible tortures, if we are taken.”"
Chapter 13,"“That is foreseen,” replied Mr. Fogg. “I think we must wait till night"
Chapter 13,before acting.”
Chapter 13,"“I think so,” said the guide."
Chapter 13,"The worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim, who, he said,"
Chapter 13,"was a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race, and the daughter of a"
Chapter 13,wealthy Bombay merchant. She had received a thoroughly English
Chapter 13,"education in that city, and, from her manners and intelligence, would"
Chapter 13,"be thought an European. Her name was Aouda. Left an orphan, she was"
Chapter 13,"married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund; and, knowing"
Chapter 13,"the fate that awaited her, she escaped, was retaken, and devoted by the"
Chapter 13,"rajah’s relatives, who had an interest in her death, to the sacrifice"
Chapter 13,from which it seemed she could not escape.
Chapter 13,The Parsee’s narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in
Chapter 13,their generous design. It was decided that the guide should direct the
Chapter 13,"elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji, which he accordingly approached"
Chapter 13,"as quickly as possible. They halted, half an hour afterwards, in a"
Chapter 13,"copse, some five hundred feet from the pagoda, where they were well"
Chapter 13,concealed; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs
Chapter 13,distinctly.
Chapter 13,They then discussed the means of getting at the victim. The guide was
Chapter 13,"familiar with the pagoda of Pillaji, in which, as he declared, the"
Chapter 13,young woman was imprisoned. Could they enter any of its doors while the
Chapter 13,"whole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep, or was it safer"
Chapter 13,to attempt to make a hole in the walls? This could only be determined
Chapter 13,at the moment and the place themselves; but it was certain that the
Chapter 13,"abduction must be made that night, and not when, at break of day, the"
Chapter 13,victim was led to her funeral pyre. Then no human intervention could
Chapter 13,save her.
Chapter 13,"As soon as night fell, about six o’clock, they decided to make a"
Chapter 13,reconnaissance around the pagoda. The cries of the fakirs were just
Chapter 13,ceasing; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the
Chapter 13,"drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp, and it might be"
Chapter 13,possible to slip between them to the temple itself.
Chapter 13,"The Parsee, leading the others, noiselessly crept through the wood, and"
Chapter 13,"in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream,"
Chapter 13,"whence, by the light of the rosin torches, they perceived a pyre of"
Chapter 13,"wood, on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah, which was"
Chapter 13,"to be burned with his wife. The pagoda, whose minarets loomed above the"
Chapter 13,"trees in the deepening dusk, stood a hundred steps away."
Chapter 13,“Come!” whispered the guide.
Chapter 13,"He slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush, followed by his"
Chapter 13,companions; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of
Chapter 13,the wind among the branches.
Chapter 13,"Soon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which was lit up"
Chapter 13,"by the torches. The ground was covered by groups of the Indians,"
Chapter 13,motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield strewn with
Chapter 13,"the dead. Men, women, and children lay together."
Chapter 13,"In the background, among the trees, the pagoda of Pillaji loomed"
Chapter 13,"distinctly. Much to the guide’s disappointment, the guards of the"
Chapter 13,"rajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and marching to"
Chapter 13,"and fro with naked sabres; probably the priests, too, were watching"
Chapter 13,within.
Chapter 13,"The Parsee, now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance"
Chapter 13,"to the temple, advanced no farther, but led his companions back again."
Chapter 13,Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty also saw that nothing could be
Chapter 13,"attempted in that direction. They stopped, and engaged in a whispered"
Chapter 13,colloquy.
Chapter 13,"“It is only eight now,” said the brigadier, “and these guards may also"
Chapter 13,go to sleep.”
Chapter 13,"“It is not impossible,” returned the Parsee."
Chapter 13,"They lay down at the foot of a tree, and waited."
Chapter 13,The time seemed long; the guide ever and anon left them to take an
Chapter 13,"observation on the edge of the wood, but the guards watched steadily by"
Chapter 13,"the glare of the torches, and a dim light crept through the windows of"
Chapter 13,the pagoda.
Chapter 13,"They waited till midnight; but no change took place among the guards,"
Chapter 13,and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be
Chapter 13,counted on. The other plan must be carried out; an opening in the walls
Chapter 13,of the pagoda must be made. It remained to ascertain whether the
Chapter 13,priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as
Chapter 13,were the soldiers at the door.
Chapter 13,"After a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready for"
Chapter 13,"the attempt, and advanced, followed by the others. They took a"
Chapter 13,"roundabout way, so as to get at the pagoda on the rear. They reached"
Chapter 13,"the walls about half-past twelve, without having met anyone; here there"
Chapter 13,"was no guard, nor were there either windows or doors."
Chapter 13,"The night was dark. The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon,"
Chapter 13,and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the
Chapter 13,darkness.
Chapter 13,It was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be
Chapter 13,"accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their"
Chapter 13,"pocket-knives. Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood,"
Chapter 13,which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had
Chapter 13,"been taken out, the rest would yield easily."
Chapter 13,"They set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and"
Chapter 13,Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an
Chapter 13,"aperture two feet wide. They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a"
Chapter 13,"cry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed almost instantly"
Chapter 13,by other cries replying from the outside. Passepartout and the guide
Chapter 13,stopped. Had they been heard? Was the alarm being given? Common
Chapter 13,"prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas"
Chapter 13,"Fogg and Sir Francis. They again hid themselves in the wood, and waited"
Chapter 13,"till the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding themselves"
Chapter 13,"ready to resume their attempt without delay. But, awkwardly enough, the"
Chapter 13,"guards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there installed"
Chapter 13,"themselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise."
Chapter 13,"It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party, thus"
Chapter 13,"interrupted in their work. They could not now reach the victim; how,"
Chapter 13,"then, could they save her? Sir Francis shook his fists, Passepartout"
Chapter 13,"was beside himself, and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage. The"
Chapter 13,"tranquil Fogg waited, without betraying any emotion."
Chapter 13,"“We have nothing to do but to go away,” whispered Sir Francis."
Chapter 13,"“Nothing but to go away,” echoed the guide."
Chapter 13,"“Stop,” said Fogg. “I am only due at Allahabad tomorrow before noon.”"
Chapter 13,“But what can you hope to do?” asked Sir Francis. “In a few hours it
Chapter 13,"will be daylight, and—”"
Chapter 13,“The chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last
Chapter 13,moment.”
Chapter 13,Sir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Fogg’s eyes. What was this
Chapter 13,cool Englishman thinking of? Was he planning to make a rush for the
Chapter 13,"young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice, and boldly snatch her"
Chapter 13,from her executioners?
Chapter 13,"This would be utter folly, and it was hard to admit that Fogg was such"
Chapter 13,"a fool. Sir Francis consented, however, to remain to the end of this"
Chapter 13,"terrible drama. The guide led them to the rear of the glade, where they"
Chapter 13,were able to observe the sleeping groups.
Chapter 13,"Meanwhile Passepartout, who had perched himself on the lower branches"
Chapter 13,"of a tree, was resolving an idea which had at first struck him like a"
Chapter 13,"flash, and which was now firmly lodged in his brain."
Chapter 13,"He had commenced by saying to himself, “What folly!” and then he"
Chapter 13,"repeated, “Why not, after all? It’s a chance,—perhaps the only one; and"
Chapter 13,"with such sots!” Thinking thus, he slipped, with the suppleness of a"
Chapter 13,"serpent, to the lowest branches, the ends of which bent almost to the"
Chapter 13,ground.
Chapter 13,"The hours passed, and the lighter shades now announced the approach of"
Chapter 13,"day, though it was not yet light. This was the moment. The slumbering"
Chapter 13,"multitude became animated, the tambourines sounded, songs and cries"
Chapter 13,arose; the hour of the sacrifice had come. The doors of the pagoda
Chapter 13,"swung open, and a bright light escaped from its interior, in the midst"
Chapter 13,"of which Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis espied the victim. She seemed, having"
Chapter 13,"shaken off the stupor of intoxication, to be striving to escape from"
Chapter 13,"her executioner. Sir Francis’s heart throbbed; and, convulsively"
Chapter 13,"seizing Mr. Fogg’s hand, found in it an open knife. Just at this moment"
Chapter 13,the crowd began to move. The young woman had again fallen into a stupor
Chapter 13,"caused by the fumes of hemp, and passed among the fakirs, who escorted"
Chapter 13,"her with their wild, religious cries."
Chapter 13,"Phileas Fogg and his companions, mingling in the rear ranks of the"
Chapter 13,"crowd, followed; and in two minutes they reached the banks of the"
Chapter 13,"stream, and stopped fifty paces from the pyre, upon which still lay the"
Chapter 13,"rajah’s corpse. In the semi-obscurity they saw the victim, quite"
Chapter 13,"senseless, stretched out beside her husband’s body. Then a torch was"
Chapter 13,"brought, and the wood, heavily soaked with oil, instantly took fire."
Chapter 13,"At this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg, who, in"
Chapter 13,"an instant of mad generosity, was about to rush upon the pyre. But he"
Chapter 13,"had quickly pushed them aside, when the whole scene suddenly changed. A"
Chapter 13,"cry of terror arose. The whole multitude prostrated themselves,"
Chapter 13,"terror-stricken, on the ground."
Chapter 13,"The old rajah was not dead, then, since he rose of a sudden, like a"
Chapter 13,"spectre, took up his wife in his arms, and descended from the pyre in"
Chapter 13,"the midst of the clouds of smoke, which only heightened his ghostly"
Chapter 13,appearance.
Chapter 13,"Fakirs and soldiers and priests, seized with instant terror, lay there,"
Chapter 13,"with their faces on the ground, not daring to lift their eyes and"
Chapter 13,behold such a prodigy.
Chapter 13,The inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which
Chapter 13,"supported her, and which she did not seem in the least to burden. Mr."
Chapter 13,"Fogg and Sir Francis stood erect, the Parsee bowed his head, and"
Chapter 13,"Passepartout was, no doubt, scarcely less stupefied."
Chapter 13,"The resuscitated rajah approached Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg, and, in an"
Chapter 13,"abrupt tone, said, “Let us be off!”"
Chapter 13,"It was Passepartout himself, who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst"
Chapter 13,"of the smoke and, profiting by the still overhanging darkness, had"
Chapter 13,"delivered the young woman from death! It was Passepartout who, playing"
Chapter 13,"his part with a happy audacity, had passed through the crowd amid the"
Chapter 13,general terror.
Chapter 13,"A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods, and"
Chapter 13,the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace. But the cries and
Chapter 13,"noise, and a ball which whizzed through Phileas Fogg’s hat, apprised"
Chapter 13,them that the trick had been discovered.
Chapter 13,"The old rajah’s body, indeed, now appeared upon the burning pyre; and"
Chapter 13,"the priests, recovered from their terror, perceived that an abduction"
Chapter 13,"had taken place. They hastened into the forest, followed by the"
Chapter 13,"soldiers, who fired a volley after the fugitives; but the latter"
Chapter 13,"rapidly increased the distance between them, and ere long found"
Chapter 13,themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and arrows.
Chapter 14,CHAPTER XIV.
Chapter 14,IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG DESCENDS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BEAUTIFUL VALLEY
Chapter 14,OF THE GANGES WITHOUT EVER THINKING OF SEEING IT
Chapter 14,The rash exploit had been accomplished; and for an hour Passepartout
Chapter 14,laughed gaily at his success. Sir Francis pressed the worthy fellow’s
Chapter 14,"hand, and his master said, “Well done!” which, from him, was high"
Chapter 14,commendation; to which Passepartout replied that all the credit of the
Chapter 14,"affair belonged to Mr. Fogg. As for him, he had only been struck with a"
Chapter 14,"“queer” idea; and he laughed to think that for a few moments he,"
Chapter 14,"Passepartout, the ex-gymnast, ex-sergeant fireman, had been the spouse"
Chapter 14,"of a charming woman, a venerable, embalmed rajah! As for the young"
Chapter 14,"Indian woman, she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing,"
Chapter 14,"and now, wrapped up in a travelling-blanket, was reposing in one of the"
Chapter 14,howdahs.
Chapter 14,"The elephant, thanks to the skilful guidance of the Parsee, was"
Chapter 14,"advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest, and, an hour after"
Chapter 14,"leaving the pagoda, had crossed a vast plain. They made a halt at seven"
Chapter 14,"o’clock, the young woman being still in a state of complete"
Chapter 14,"prostration. The guide made her drink a little brandy and water, but"
Chapter 14,the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off. Sir
Chapter 14,"Francis, who was familiar with the effects of the intoxication produced"
Chapter 14,"by the fumes of hemp, reassured his companions on her account. But he"
Chapter 14,was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate. He told Phileas
Chapter 14,"Fogg that, should Aouda remain in India, she would inevitably fall"
Chapter 14,again into the hands of her executioners. These fanatics were scattered
Chapter 14,"throughout the county, and would, despite the English police, recover"
Chapter 14,"their victim at Madras, Bombay, or Calcutta. She would only be safe by"
Chapter 14,quitting India for ever.
Chapter 14,Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter.
Chapter 14,"The station at Allahabad was reached about ten o’clock, and, the"
Chapter 14,"interrupted line of railway being resumed, would enable them to reach"
Chapter 14,Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours. Phileas Fogg would thus be
Chapter 14,able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left Calcutta the next
Chapter 14,"day, October 25th, at noon, for Hong Kong."
Chapter 14,"The young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the station,"
Chapter 14,whilst Passepartout was charged with purchasing for her various
Chapter 14,"articles of toilet, a dress, shawl, and some furs; for which his master"
Chapter 14,"gave him unlimited credit. Passepartout started off forthwith, and"
Chapter 14,"found himself in the streets of Allahabad, that is, the City of God,"
Chapter 14,"one of the most venerated in India, being built at the junction of the"
Chapter 14,"two sacred rivers, Ganges and Jumna, the waters of which attract"
Chapter 14,"pilgrims from every part of the peninsula. The Ganges, according to the"
Chapter 14,"legends of the Ramayana, rises in heaven, whence, owing to Brahma’s"
Chapter 14,"agency, it descends to the earth."
Chapter 14,"Passepartout made it a point, as he made his purchases, to take a good"
Chapter 14,"look at the city. It was formerly defended by a noble fort, which has"
Chapter 14,"since become a state prison; its commerce has dwindled away, and"
Chapter 14,Passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to
Chapter 14,"frequent in Regent Street. At last he came upon an elderly, crusty Jew,"
Chapter 14,"who sold second-hand articles, and from whom he purchased a dress of"
Chapter 14,"Scotch stuff, a large mantle, and a fine otter-skin pelisse, for which"
Chapter 14,he did not hesitate to pay seventy-five pounds. He then returned
Chapter 14,triumphantly to the station.
Chapter 14,The influence to which the priests of Pillaji had subjected Aouda began
Chapter 14,"gradually to yield, and she became more herself, so that her fine eyes"
Chapter 14,resumed all their soft Indian expression.
Chapter 14,"When the poet-king, Ucaf Uddaul, celebrates the charms of the queen of"
Chapter 14,"Ahmehnagara, he speaks thus:"
Chapter 14,"“Her shining tresses, divided in two parts, encircle the harmonious"
Chapter 14,"contour of her white and delicate cheeks, brilliant in their glow and"
Chapter 14,"freshness. Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama,"
Chapter 14,"the god of love, and beneath her long silken lashes the purest"
Chapter 14,"reflections and a celestial light swim, as in the sacred lakes of"
Chapter 14,"Himalaya, in the black pupils of her great clear eyes. Her teeth, fine,"
Chapter 14,"equal, and white, glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a"
Chapter 14,"passion-flower’s half-enveloped breast. Her delicately formed ears, her"
Chapter 14,"vermilion hands, her little feet, curved and tender as the lotus-bud,"
Chapter 14,"glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon, the most"
Chapter 14,"dazzling diamonds of Golconda. Her narrow and supple waist, which a"
Chapter 14,"hand may clasp around, sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and"
Chapter 14,"the beauty of her bosom, where youth in its flower displays the wealth"
Chapter 14,of its treasures; and beneath the silken folds of her tunic she seems
Chapter 14,to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike hand of
Chapter 14,"Vicvarcarma, the immortal sculptor.”"
Chapter 14,"It is enough to say, without applying this poetical rhapsody to Aouda,"
Chapter 14,"that she was a charming woman, in all the European acceptation of the"
Chapter 14,"phrase. She spoke English with great purity, and the guide had not"
Chapter 14,exaggerated in saying that the young Parsee had been transformed by her
Chapter 14,bringing up.
Chapter 14,"The train was about to start from Allahabad, and Mr. Fogg proceeded to"
Chapter 14,"pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service, and not a farthing"
Chapter 14,"more; which astonished Passepartout, who remembered all that his master"
Chapter 14,"owed to the guide’s devotion. He had, indeed, risked his life in the"
Chapter 14,"adventure at Pillaji, and, if he should be caught afterwards by the"
Chapter 14,"Indians, he would with difficulty escape their vengeance. Kiouni, also,"
Chapter 14,"must be disposed of. What should be done with the elephant, which had"
Chapter 14,been so dearly purchased? Phileas Fogg had already determined this
Chapter 14,question.
Chapter 14,"“Parsee,” said he to the guide, “you have been serviceable and devoted."
Chapter 14,"I have paid for your service, but not for your devotion. Would you like"
Chapter 14,to have this elephant? He is yours.”
Chapter 14,The guide’s eyes glistened.
Chapter 14,“Your honour is giving me a fortune!” cried he.
Chapter 14,"“Take him, guide,” returned Mr. Fogg, “and I shall still be your"
Chapter 14,debtor.”
Chapter 14,"“Good!” exclaimed Passepartout. “Take him, friend. Kiouni is a brave"
Chapter 14,"and faithful beast.” And, going up to the elephant, he gave him several"
Chapter 14,"lumps of sugar, saying, “Here, Kiouni, here, here.”"
Chapter 14,"The elephant grunted out his satisfaction, and, clasping Passepartout"
Chapter 14,"around the waist with his trunk, lifted him as high as his head."
Chapter 14,"Passepartout, not in the least alarmed, caressed the animal, which"
Chapter 14,replaced him gently on the ground.
Chapter 14,"Soon after, Phileas Fogg, Sir Francis Cromarty, and Passepartout,"
Chapter 14,"installed in a carriage with Aouda, who had the best seat, were"
Chapter 14,"whirling at full speed towards Benares. It was a run of eighty miles,"
Chapter 14,"and was accomplished in two hours. During the journey, the young woman"
Chapter 14,fully recovered her senses. What was her astonishment to find herself
Chapter 14,"in this carriage, on the railway, dressed in European habiliments, and"
Chapter 14,with travellers who were quite strangers to her! Her companions first
Chapter 14,"set about fully reviving her with a little liquor, and then Sir Francis"
Chapter 14,"narrated to her what had passed, dwelling upon the courage with which"
Chapter 14,"Phileas Fogg had not hesitated to risk his life to save her, and"
Chapter 14,"recounting the happy sequel of the venture, the result of"
Chapter 14,"Passepartout’s rash idea. Mr. Fogg said nothing; while Passepartout,"
Chapter 14,"abashed, kept repeating that “it wasn’t worth telling.”"
Chapter 14,"Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers, rather with tears than"
Chapter 14,words; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips.
Chapter 14,"Then, as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the sacrifice, and"
Chapter 14,"recalled the dangers which still menaced her, she shuddered with"
Chapter 14,terror.
Chapter 14,"Phileas Fogg understood what was passing in Aouda’s mind, and offered,"
Chapter 14,"in order to reassure her, to escort her to Hong Kong, where she might"
Chapter 14,remain safely until the affair was hushed up—an offer which she eagerly
Chapter 14,"and gratefully accepted. She had, it seems, a Parsee relation, who was"
Chapter 14,"one of the principal merchants of Hong Kong, which is wholly an English"
Chapter 14,"city, though on an island on the Chinese coast."
Chapter 14,At half-past twelve the train stopped at Benares. The Brahmin legends
Chapter 14,"assert that this city is built on the site of the ancient Casi, which,"
Chapter 14,"like Mahomet’s tomb, was once suspended between heaven and earth;"
Chapter 14,"though the Benares of to-day, which the Orientalists call the Athens of"
Chapter 14,"India, stands quite unpoetically on the solid earth, Passepartout"
Chapter 14,"caught glimpses of its brick houses and clay huts, giving an aspect of"
Chapter 14,"desolation to the place, as the train entered it."
Chapter 14,"Benares was Sir Francis Cromarty’s destination, the troops he was"
Chapter 14,rejoining being encamped some miles northward of the city. He bade
Chapter 14,"adieu to Phileas Fogg, wishing him all success, and expressing the hope"
Chapter 14,that he would come that way again in a less original but more
Chapter 14,profitable fashion. Mr. Fogg lightly pressed him by the hand. The
Chapter 14,"parting of Aouda, who did not forget what she owed to Sir Francis,"
Chapter 14,"betrayed more warmth; and, as for Passepartout, he received a hearty"
Chapter 14,shake of the hand from the gallant general.
Chapter 14,"The railway, on leaving Benares, passed for a while along the valley of"
Chapter 14,the Ganges. Through the windows of their carriage the travellers had
Chapter 14,"glimpses of the diversified landscape of Behar, with its mountains"
Chapter 14,"clothed in verdure, its fields of barley, wheat, and corn, its jungles"
Chapter 14,"peopled with green alligators, its neat villages, and its still"
Chapter 14,thickly-leaved forests. Elephants were bathing in the waters of the
Chapter 14,"sacred river, and groups of Indians, despite the advanced season and"
Chapter 14,"chilly air, were performing solemnly their pious ablutions. These were"
Chapter 14,"fervent Brahmins, the bitterest foes of Buddhism, their deities being"
Chapter 14,"Vishnu, the solar god, Shiva, the divine impersonation of natural"
Chapter 14,"forces, and Brahma, the supreme ruler of priests and legislators. What"
Chapter 14,"would these divinities think of India, anglicised as it is to-day, with"
Chapter 14,"steamers whistling and scudding along the Ganges, frightening the gulls"
Chapter 14,"which float upon its surface, the turtles swarming along its banks, and"
Chapter 14,the faithful dwelling upon its borders?
Chapter 14,"The panorama passed before their eyes like a flash, save when the steam"
Chapter 14,concealed it fitfully from the view; the travellers could scarcely
Chapter 14,"discern the fort of Chupenie, twenty miles south-westward from Benares,"
Chapter 14,the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of Behar; or Ghazipur and its
Chapter 14,"famous rose-water factories; or the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, rising on"
Chapter 14,"the left bank of the Ganges; the fortified town of Buxar, or Patna, a"
Chapter 14,"large manufacturing and trading-place, where is held the principal"
Chapter 14,"opium market of India; or Monghir, a more than European town, for it is"
Chapter 14,"as English as Manchester or Birmingham, with its iron foundries,"
Chapter 14,"edgetool factories, and high chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke"
Chapter 14,heavenward.
Chapter 14,"Night came on; the train passed on at full speed, in the midst of the"
Chapter 14,"roaring of the tigers, bears, and wolves which fled before the"
Chapter 14,"locomotive; and the marvels of Bengal, Golconda ruined Gour,"
Chapter 14,"Murshedabad, the ancient capital, Burdwan, Hugly, and the French town"
Chapter 14,"of Chandernagor, where Passepartout would have been proud to see his"
Chapter 14,"country’s flag flying, were hidden from their view in the darkness."
Chapter 14,"Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning, and the packet left for"
Chapter 14,Hong Kong at noon; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before him.
Chapter 14,"According to his journal, he was due at Calcutta on the 25th of"
Chapter 14,"October, and that was the exact date of his actual arrival. He was"
Chapter 14,therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time. The two days gained
Chapter 14,"between London and Bombay had been lost, as has been seen, in the"
Chapter 14,journey across India. But it is not to be supposed that Phileas Fogg
Chapter 14,regretted them.
Chapter 15,CHAPTER XV.
Chapter 15,IN WHICH THE BAG OF BANKNOTES DISGORGES SOME THOUSANDS OF POUNDS MORE
Chapter 15,"The train entered the station, and Passepartout jumping out first, was"
Chapter 15,"followed by Mr. Fogg, who assisted his fair companion to descend."
Chapter 15,"Phileas Fogg intended to proceed at once to the Hong Kong steamer, in"
Chapter 15,order to get Aouda comfortably settled for the voyage. He was unwilling
Chapter 15,to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground.
Chapter 15,"Just as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him, and"
Chapter 15,"said, “Mr. Phileas Fogg?”"
Chapter 15,“I am he.”
Chapter 15,"“Is this man your servant?” added the policeman, pointing to"
Chapter 15,Passepartout.
Chapter 15,“Yes.”
Chapter 15,"“Be so good, both of you, as to follow me.”"
Chapter 15,Mr. Fogg betrayed no surprise whatever. The policeman was a
Chapter 15,"representative of the law, and law is sacred to an Englishman."
Chapter 15,"Passepartout tried to reason about the matter, but the policeman tapped"
Chapter 15,"him with his stick, and Mr. Fogg made him a signal to obey."
Chapter 15,“May this young lady go with us?” asked he.
Chapter 15,"“She may,” replied the policeman."
Chapter 15,"Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri, a"
Chapter 15,"sort of four-wheeled carriage, drawn by two horses, in which they took"
Chapter 15,their places and were driven away. No one spoke during the twenty
Chapter 15,minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination. They first
Chapter 15,"passed through the “black town,” with its narrow streets, its"
Chapter 15,"miserable, dirty huts, and squalid population; then through the"
Chapter 15,"“European town,” which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions,"
Chapter 15,"shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts, where, although it"
Chapter 15,"was early morning, elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages"
Chapter 15,were passing back and forth.
Chapter 15,"The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house, which, however, did"
Chapter 15,not have the appearance of a private mansion. The policeman having
Chapter 15,"requested his prisoners—for so, truly, they might be called—to descend,"
Chapter 15,"conducted them into a room with barred windows, and said: “You will"
Chapter 15,appear before Judge Obadiah at half-past eight.”
Chapter 15,"He then retired, and closed the door."
Chapter 15,"“Why, we are prisoners!” exclaimed Passepartout, falling into a chair."
Chapter 15,"Aouda, with an emotion she tried to conceal, said to Mr. Fogg: “Sir,"
Chapter 15,you must leave me to my fate! It is on my account that you receive this
Chapter 15,"treatment, it is for having saved me!”"
Chapter 15,Phileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible. It
Chapter 15,was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee.
Chapter 15,The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge.
Chapter 15,"There was some mistake. Moreover, he would not, in any event, abandon"
Chapter 15,"Aouda, but would escort her to Hong Kong."
Chapter 15,"“But the steamer leaves at noon!” observed Passepartout, nervously."
Chapter 15,"“We shall be on board by noon,” replied his master, placidly."
Chapter 15,It was said so positively that Passepartout could not help muttering to
Chapter 15,"himself, “Parbleu that’s certain! Before noon we shall be on board.”"
Chapter 15,But he was by no means reassured.
Chapter 15,"At half-past eight the door opened, the policeman appeared, and,"
Chapter 15,"requesting them to follow him, led the way to an adjoining hall. It was"
Chapter 15,"evidently a court-room, and a crowd of Europeans and natives already"
Chapter 15,occupied the rear of the apartment.
Chapter 15,Mr. Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite
Chapter 15,"the desks of the magistrate and his clerk. Immediately after, Judge"
Chapter 15,"Obadiah, a fat, round man, followed by the clerk, entered. He proceeded"
Chapter 15,"to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail, and put it hurriedly on"
Chapter 15,his head.
Chapter 15,"“The first case,” said he. Then, putting his hand to his head, he"
Chapter 15,"exclaimed, “Heh! This is not my wig!”"
Chapter 15,"“No, your worship,” returned the clerk, “it is mine.”"
Chapter 15,"“My dear Mr. Oysterpuff, how can a judge give a wise sentence in a"
Chapter 15,clerk’s wig?”
Chapter 15,The wigs were exchanged.
Chapter 15,"Passepartout was getting nervous, for the hands on the face of the big"
Chapter 15,clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapidity.
Chapter 15,"“The first case,” repeated Judge Obadiah."
Chapter 15,“Phileas Fogg?” demanded Oysterpuff.
Chapter 15,"“I am here,” replied Mr. Fogg."
Chapter 15,“Passepartout?”
Chapter 15,"“Present,” responded Passepartout."
Chapter 15,"“Good,” said the judge. “You have been looked for, prisoners, for two"
Chapter 15,days on the trains from Bombay.”
Chapter 15,"“But of what are we accused?” asked Passepartout, impatiently."
Chapter 15,“You are about to be informed.”
Chapter 15,"“I am an English subject, sir,” said Mr. Fogg, “and I have the right—”"
Chapter 15,“Have you been ill-treated?”
Chapter 15,“Not at all.”
Chapter 15,“Very well; let the complainants come in.”
Chapter 15,"A door was swung open by order of the judge, and three Indian priests"
Chapter 15,entered.
Chapter 15,"“That’s it,” muttered Passepartout; “these are the rogues who were"
Chapter 15,going to burn our young lady.”
Chapter 15,"The priests took their places in front of the judge, and the clerk"
Chapter 15,proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against
Chapter 15,"Phileas Fogg and his servant, who were accused of having violated a"
Chapter 15,place held consecrated by the Brahmin religion.
Chapter 15,“You hear the charge?” asked the judge.
Chapter 15,"“Yes, sir,” replied Mr. Fogg, consulting his watch, “and I admit it.”"
Chapter 15,“You admit it?”
Chapter 15,"“I admit it, and I wish to hear these priests admit, in their turn,"
Chapter 15,what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji.”
Chapter 15,The priests looked at each other; they did not seem to understand what
Chapter 15,was said.
Chapter 15,"“Yes,” cried Passepartout, warmly; “at the pagoda of Pillaji, where"
Chapter 15,they were on the point of burning their victim.”
Chapter 15,"The judge stared with astonishment, and the priests were stupefied."
Chapter 15,“What victim?” said Judge Obadiah. “Burn whom? In Bombay itself?”
Chapter 15,“Bombay?” cried Passepartout.
Chapter 15,"“Certainly. We are not talking of the pagoda of Pillaji, but of the"
Chapter 15,"pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay.”"
Chapter 15,"“And as a proof,” added the clerk, “here are the desecrator’s very"
Chapter 15,"shoes, which he left behind him.”"
Chapter 15,Whereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk.
Chapter 15,"“My shoes!” cried Passepartout, in his surprise permitting this"
Chapter 15,imprudent exclamation to escape him.
Chapter 15,"The confusion of master and man, who had quite forgotten the affair at"
Chapter 15,"Bombay, for which they were now detained at Calcutta, may be imagined."
Chapter 15,"Fix the detective, had foreseen the advantage which Passepartout’s"
Chapter 15,"escapade gave him, and, delaying his departure for twelve hours, had"
Chapter 15,consulted the priests of Malabar Hill. Knowing that the English
Chapter 15,"authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour, he"
Chapter 15,"promised them a goodly sum in damages, and sent them forward to"
Chapter 15,Calcutta by the next train. Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of
Chapter 15,"the young widow, Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before"
Chapter 15,"Mr. Fogg and his servant, the magistrates having been already warned by"
Chapter 15,a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive. Fix’s disappointment when
Chapter 15,he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta
Chapter 15,may be imagined. He made up his mind that the robber had stopped
Chapter 15,somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces. For
Chapter 15,twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish anxiety; at
Chapter 15,"last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout arrive,"
Chapter 15,"accompanied by a young woman, whose presence he was wholly at a loss to"
Chapter 15,explain. He hastened for a policeman; and this was how the party came
Chapter 15,to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah.
Chapter 15,"Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied, he would have espied"
Chapter 15,"the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room, watching the"
Chapter 15,proceedings with an interest easily understood; for the warrant had
Chapter 15,"failed to reach him at Calcutta, as it had done at Bombay and Suez."
Chapter 15,"Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout’s rash exclamation,"
Chapter 15,which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall.
Chapter 15,“The facts are admitted?” asked the judge.
Chapter 15,"“Admitted,” replied Mr. Fogg, coldly."
Chapter 15,"“Inasmuch,” resumed the judge, “as the English law protects equally and"
Chapter 15,"sternly the religions of the Indian people, and as the man Passepartout"
Chapter 15,"has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill, at"
Chapter 15,"Bombay, on the 20th of October, I condemn the said Passepartout to"
Chapter 15,imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds.”
Chapter 15,"“Three hundred pounds!” cried Passepartout, startled at the largeness"
Chapter 15,of the sum.
Chapter 15,“Silence!” shouted the constable.
Chapter 15,"“And inasmuch,” continued the judge, “as it is not proved that the act"
Chapter 15,"was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant, and as"
Chapter 15,the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his
Chapter 15,"paid servant, I condemn Phileas Fogg to a week’s imprisonment and a"
Chapter 15,fine of one hundred and fifty pounds.”
Chapter 15,Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if Phileas Fogg could be
Chapter 15,"detained in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time for the warrant"
Chapter 15,to arrive. Passepartout was stupefied. This sentence ruined his master.
Chapter 15,"A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost, because he, like a precious"
Chapter 15,"fool, had gone into that abominable pagoda!"
Chapter 15,"Phileas Fogg, as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least"
Chapter 15,"concern him, did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being"
Chapter 15,"pronounced. Just as the clerk was calling the next case, he rose, and"
Chapter 15,"said, “I offer bail.”"
Chapter 15,"“You have that right,” returned the judge."
Chapter 15,"Fix’s blood ran cold, but he resumed his composure when he heard the"
Chapter 15,judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one
Chapter 15,thousand pounds.
Chapter 15,"“I will pay it at once,” said Mr. Fogg, taking a roll of bank-bills"
Chapter 15,"from the carpet-bag, which Passepartout had by him, and placing them on"
Chapter 15,the clerk’s desk.
Chapter 15,"“This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison,” said"
Chapter 15,"the judge. “Meanwhile, you are liberated on bail.”"
Chapter 15,“Come!” said Phileas Fogg to his servant.
Chapter 15,“But let them at least give me back my shoes!” cried Passepartout
Chapter 15,angrily.
Chapter 15,"“Ah, these are pretty dear shoes!” he muttered, as they were handed to"
Chapter 15,"him. “More than a thousand pounds apiece; besides, they pinch my feet.”"
Chapter 15,"Mr. Fogg, offering his arm to Aouda, then departed, followed by the"
Chapter 15,crestfallen Passepartout. Fix still nourished hopes that the robber
Chapter 15,"would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds behind him, but"
Chapter 15,"would decide to serve out his week in jail, and issued forth on Mr."
Chapter 15,"Fogg’s traces. That gentleman took a carriage, and the party were soon"
Chapter 15,landed on one of the quays.
Chapter 15,"The “Rangoon” was moored half a mile off in the harbour, its signal of"
Chapter 15,departure hoisted at the mast-head. Eleven o’clock was striking; Mr.
Chapter 15,Fogg was an hour in advance of time. Fix saw them leave the carriage
Chapter 15,"and push off in a boat for the steamer, and stamped his feet with"
Chapter 15,disappointment.
Chapter 15,"“The rascal is off, after all!” he exclaimed. “Two thousand pounds"
Chapter 15,sacrificed! He’s as prodigal as a thief! I’ll follow him to the end of
Chapter 15,"the world if necessary; but, at the rate he is going on, the stolen"
Chapter 15,money will soon be exhausted.”
Chapter 15,The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture. Since
Chapter 15,"leaving London, what with travelling expenses, bribes, the purchase of"
Chapter 15,"the elephant, bails, and fines, Mr. Fogg had already spent more than"
Chapter 15,"five thousand pounds on the way, and the percentage of the sum"
Chapter 15,"recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives, was rapidly"
Chapter 15,diminishing.
Chapter 16,CHAPTER XVI.
Chapter 16,IN WHICH FIX DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST WHAT IS SAID TO
Chapter 16,HIM
Chapter 16,The “Rangoon”—one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company’s boats plying
Chapter 16,"in the Chinese and Japanese seas—was a screw steamer, built of iron,"
Chapter 16,"weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons, and with engines of"
Chapter 16,"four hundred horse-power. She was as fast, but not as well fitted up,"
Chapter 16,"as the “Mongolia,” and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on"
Chapter 16,"board of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished. However, the trip from"
Chapter 16,Calcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred
Chapter 16,"miles, occupying from ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not"
Chapter 16,difficult to please.
Chapter 16,During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted
Chapter 16,"with her protector, and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude"
Chapter 16,"for what he had done. The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her,"
Chapter 16,"apparently at least, with coldness, neither his voice nor his manner"
Chapter 16,betraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always on the
Chapter 16,watch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda’s comfort. He visited her
Chapter 16,"regularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself, as to"
Chapter 16,"sit and hear her talk. He treated her with the strictest politeness,"
Chapter 16,"but with the precision of an automaton, the movements of which had been"
Chapter 16,arranged for this purpose. Aouda did not quite know what to make of
Chapter 16,"him, though Passepartout had given her some hints of his master’s"
Chapter 16,"eccentricity, and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was"
Chapter 16,"sending him round the world. After all, she owed Phileas Fogg her life,"
Chapter 16,and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her
Chapter 16,gratitude.
Chapter 16,Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide’s narrative of her touching history.
Chapter 16,"She did, indeed, belong to the highest of the native races of India."
Chapter 16,Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing
Chapter 16,"in cotton; and one of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, was made a baronet"
Chapter 16,"by the English government. Aouda was a relative of this great man, and"
Chapter 16,"it was his cousin, Jeejeeh, whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong."
Chapter 16,Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell; but Mr.
Chapter 16,"Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties, and to assure her that everything"
Chapter 16,would be mathematically—he used the very word—arranged. Aouda fastened
Chapter 16,"her great eyes, “clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya,” upon him;"
Chapter 16,"but the intractable Fogg, as reserved as ever, did not seem at all"
Chapter 16,inclined to throw himself into this lake.
Chapter 16,"The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously, amid favourable"
Chapter 16,"weather and propitious winds, and they soon came in sight of the great"
Chapter 16,"Andaman, the principal of the islands in the Bay of Bengal, with its"
Chapter 16,"picturesque Saddle Peak, two thousand four hundred feet high, looming"
Chapter 16,"above the waters. The steamer passed along near the shores, but the"
Chapter 16,"savage Papuans, who are in the lowest scale of humanity, but are not,"
Chapter 16,"as has been asserted, cannibals, did not make their appearance."
Chapter 16,"The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb. Vast"
Chapter 16,"forests of palms, arecs, bamboo, teakwood, of the gigantic mimosa, and"
Chapter 16,"tree-like ferns covered the foreground, while behind, the graceful"
Chapter 16,outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky; and along the
Chapter 16,coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a
Chapter 16,luxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire. The varied
Chapter 16,"landscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed, however, and"
Chapter 16,"the “Rangoon” rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca, which gave"
Chapter 16,access to the China seas.
Chapter 16,"What was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country to country,"
Chapter 16,doing all this while? He had managed to embark on the “Rangoon” at
Chapter 16,"Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout, after leaving orders that,"
Chapter 16,"if the warrant should arrive, it should be forwarded to him at Hong"
Chapter 16,Kong; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage. It
Chapter 16,would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without
Chapter 16,"awakening Passepartout’s suspicions, who thought him still at Bombay."
Chapter 16,"But necessity impelled him, nevertheless, to renew his acquaintance"
Chapter 16,"with the worthy servant, as will be seen."
Chapter 16,All the detective’s hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong; for
Chapter 16,the steamer’s stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to
Chapter 16,"take any steps there. The arrest must be made at Hong Kong, or the"
Chapter 16,robber would probably escape him for ever. Hong Kong was the last
Chapter 16,"English ground on which he would set foot; beyond, China, Japan,"
Chapter 16,America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge. If the warrant should
Chapter 16,"at last make its appearance at Hong Kong, Fix could arrest him and give"
Chapter 16,"him into the hands of the local police, and there would be no further"
Chapter 16,"trouble. But beyond Hong Kong, a simple warrant would be of no avail;"
Chapter 16,"an extradition warrant would be necessary, and that would result in"
Chapter 16,"delays and obstacles, of which the rascal would take advantage to elude"
Chapter 16,justice.
Chapter 16,Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he
Chapter 16,"spent in his cabin, and kept repeating to himself, “Now, either the"
Chapter 16,"warrant will be at Hong Kong, in which case I shall arrest my man, or"
Chapter 16,it will not be there; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I
Chapter 16,"should delay his departure. I have failed at Bombay, and I have failed"
Chapter 16,"at Calcutta; if I fail at Hong Kong, my reputation is lost: Cost what"
Chapter 16,"it may, I _must_ succeed! But how shall I prevent his departure, if"
Chapter 16,that should turn out to be my last resource?”
Chapter 16,"Fix made up his mind that, if worst came to worst, he would make a"
Chapter 16,"confidant of Passepartout, and tell him what kind of a fellow his"
Chapter 16,"master really was. That Passepartout was not Fogg’s accomplice, he was"
Chapter 16,"very certain. The servant, enlightened by his disclosure, and afraid of"
Chapter 16,"being himself implicated in the crime, would doubtless become an ally"
Chapter 16,"of the detective. But this method was a dangerous one, only to be"
Chapter 16,employed when everything else had failed. A word from Passepartout to
Chapter 16,his master would ruin all. The detective was therefore in a sore
Chapter 16,strait. But suddenly a new idea struck him. The presence of Aouda on
Chapter 16,"the “Rangoon,” in company with Phileas Fogg, gave him new material for"
Chapter 16,reflection.
Chapter 16,Who was this woman? What combination of events had made her Fogg’s
Chapter 16,travelling companion? They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay
Chapter 16,"and Calcutta; but where? Had they met accidentally, or had Fogg gone"
Chapter 16,into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel? Fix was
Chapter 16,fairly puzzled. He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked
Chapter 16,elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he
Chapter 16,determined to make use of the supposed intrigue. Whether the young
Chapter 16,"woman were married or not, he would be able to create such difficulties"
Chapter 16,for Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount
Chapter 16,of money.
Chapter 16,But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong? Fogg had an
Chapter 16,"abominable way of jumping from one boat to another, and, before"
Chapter 16,"anything could be effected, might get full under way again for"
Chapter 16,Yokohama.
Chapter 16,"Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities, and signal the"
Chapter 16,"“Rangoon” before her arrival. This was easy to do, since the steamer"
Chapter 16,"stopped at Singapore, whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong."
Chapter 16,"He finally resolved, moreover, before acting more positively, to"
Chapter 16,"question Passepartout. It would not be difficult to make him talk; and,"
Chapter 16,"as there was no time to lose, Fix prepared to make himself known."
Chapter 16,"It was now the 30th of October, and on the following day the “Rangoon”"
Chapter 16,was due at Singapore.
Chapter 16,Fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck. Passepartout was
Chapter 16,promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer. The
Chapter 16,"detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise, and"
Chapter 16,"exclaimed, “You here, on the ‘Rangoon’?”"
Chapter 16,"“What, Monsieur Fix, are you on board?” returned the really astonished"
Chapter 16,"Passepartout, recognising his crony of the “Mongolia.” “Why, I left you"
Chapter 16,"at Bombay, and here you are, on the way to Hong Kong! Are you going"
Chapter 16,round the world too?”
Chapter 16,"“No, no,” replied Fix; “I shall stop at Hong Kong—at least for some"
Chapter 16,days.”
Chapter 16,"“Hum!” said Passepartout, who seemed for an instant perplexed. “But how"
Chapter 16,is it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta?”
Chapter 16,"“Oh, a trifle of sea-sickness—I’ve been staying in my berth. The Gulf"
Chapter 16,of Bengal does not agree with me as well as the Indian Ocean. And how
Chapter 16,is Mr. Fogg?”
Chapter 16,"“As well and as punctual as ever, not a day behind time! But, Monsieur"
Chapter 16,"Fix, you don’t know that we have a young lady with us.”"
Chapter 16,"“A young lady?” replied the detective, not seeming to comprehend what"
Chapter 16,was said.
Chapter 16,"Passepartout thereupon recounted Aouda’s history, the affair at the"
Chapter 16,"Bombay pagoda, the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds,"
Chapter 16,"the rescue, the arrest, and sentence of the Calcutta court, and the"
Chapter 16,"restoration of Mr. Fogg and himself to liberty on bail. Fix, who was"
Chapter 16,"familiar with the last events, seemed to be equally ignorant of all"
Chapter 16,that Passepartout related; and the later was charmed to find so
Chapter 16,interested a listener.
Chapter 16,“But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe?”
Chapter 16,“Not at all. We are simply going to place her under the protection of
Chapter 16,"one of her relatives, a rich merchant at Hong Kong.”"
Chapter 16,"“Nothing to be done there,” said Fix to himself, concealing his"
Chapter 16,"disappointment. “A glass of gin, Mr. Passepartout?”"
Chapter 16,"“Willingly, Monsieur Fix. We must at least have a friendly glass on"
Chapter 16,board the ‘Rangoon.’”
Chapter 17,CHAPTER XVII.
Chapter 17,SHOWING WHAT HAPPENED ON THE VOYAGE FROM SINGAPORE TO HONG KONG
Chapter 17,"The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview,"
Chapter 17,"though Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce his companion to"
Chapter 17,divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg. He caught a glimpse of that
Chapter 17,mysterious gentleman once or twice; but Mr. Fogg usually confined
Chapter 17,"himself to the cabin, where he kept Aouda company, or, according to his"
Chapter 17,"inveterate habit, took a hand at whist."
Chapter 17,Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance
Chapter 17,kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing. It was really
Chapter 17,worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent
Chapter 17,"person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board"
Chapter 17,"the “Mongolia,” who disembarked at Bombay, which he announced as his"
Chapter 17,"destination, and now turned up so unexpectedly on the “Rangoon,” was"
Chapter 17,following Mr. Fogg’s tracks step by step. What was Fix’s object?
Chapter 17,Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes—which he religiously
Chapter 17,preserved—that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with
Chapter 17,"them, and probably on the same steamer."
Chapter 17,Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without
Chapter 17,hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view. He never
Chapter 17,could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber
Chapter 17,"around the globe. But, as it is in human nature to attempt the solution"
Chapter 17,"of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of"
Chapter 17,"Fix’s movements, which was in truth far from unreasonable. Fix, he"
Chapter 17,"thought, could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg’s friends at the Reform"
Chapter 17,"Club, sent to follow him up, and to ascertain that he really went round"
Chapter 17,the world as had been agreed upon.
Chapter 17,"“It’s clear!” repeated the worthy servant to himself, proud of his"
Chapter 17,shrewdness. “He’s a spy sent to keep us in view! That isn’t quite the
Chapter 17,"thing, either, to be spying Mr. Fogg, who is so honourable a man! Ah,"
Chapter 17,"gentlemen of the Reform, this shall cost you dear!”"
Chapter 17,"Passepartout, enchanted with his discovery, resolved to say nothing to"
Chapter 17,"his master, lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the"
Chapter 17,"part of his adversaries. But he determined to chaff Fix, when he had"
Chapter 17,"the chance, with mysterious allusions, which, however, need not betray"
Chapter 17,his real suspicions.
Chapter 17,"During the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the “Rangoon” entered"
Chapter 17,"the Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of that name from"
Chapter 17,Sumatra. The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of
Chapter 17,this noble island from the view of the travellers. The “Rangoon”
Chapter 17,"weighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m., to receive coal,"
Chapter 17,having gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival. Phileas
Chapter 17,"Fogg noted this gain in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda,"
Chapter 17,"who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore, disembarked."
Chapter 17,"Fix, who suspected Mr. Fogg’s every movement, followed them cautiously,"
Chapter 17,"without being himself perceived; while Passepartout, laughing in his"
Chapter 17,"sleeve at Fix’s manœuvres, went about his usual errands."
Chapter 17,"The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there are no"
Chapter 17,mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions. It is a park
Chapter 17,"checkered by pleasant highways and avenues. A handsome carriage, drawn"
Chapter 17,"by a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda"
Chapter 17,"into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage, and of"
Chapter 17,"clove-trees, whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower."
Chapter 17,Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields;
Chapter 17,"sago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of"
Chapter 17,this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air
Chapter 17,with a penetrating perfume. Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped
Chapter 17,"about in the trees, nor were tigers wanting in the jungles."
Chapter 17,"After a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr. Fogg"
Chapter 17,"returned to the town, which is a vast collection of heavy-looking,"
Chapter 17,"irregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical"
Chapter 17,"fruits and plants; and at ten o’clock they re-embarked, closely"
Chapter 17,"followed by the detective, who had kept them constantly in sight."
Chapter 17,"Passepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes—a fruit as"
Chapter 17,"large as good-sized apples, of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright"
Chapter 17,"red within, and whose white pulp, melting in the mouth, affords"
Chapter 17,gourmands a delicious sensation—was waiting for them on deck. He was
Chapter 17,"only too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda, who thanked him very"
Chapter 17,gracefully for them.
Chapter 17,"At eleven o’clock the “Rangoon” rode out of Singapore harbour, and in a"
Chapter 17,"few hours the high mountains of Malacca, with their forests, inhabited"
Chapter 17,"by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world, were lost to view."
Chapter 17,Singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of
Chapter 17,"Hong Kong, which is a little English colony near the Chinese coast."
Chapter 17,"Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days, so as to be"
Chapter 17,in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for
Chapter 17,"Yokohama, the principal Japanese port."
Chapter 17,"The “Rangoon” had a large quota of passengers, many of whom disembarked"
Chapter 17,"at Singapore, among them a number of Indians, Ceylonese, Chinamen,"
Chapter 17,"Malays, and Portuguese, mostly second-class travellers."
Chapter 17,"The weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the last"
Chapter 17,"quarter of the moon. The sea rolled heavily, and the wind at intervals"
Chapter 17,"rose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the south-west, and thus"
Chapter 17,aided the steamer’s progress. The captain as often as possible put up
Chapter 17,"his sails, and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel"
Chapter 17,made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China. Owing to
Chapter 17,"the defective construction of the “Rangoon,” however, unusual"
Chapter 17,precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of
Chapter 17,"time which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout"
Chapter 17,"out of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least."
Chapter 17,"Passepartout blamed the captain, the engineer, and the crew, and"
Chapter 17,consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the
Chapter 17,"pepper grows. Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly"
Chapter 17,"burning at his expense in Saville Row, had something to do with his hot"
Chapter 17,impatience.
Chapter 17,"“You are in a great hurry, then,” said Fix to him one day, “to reach"
Chapter 17,Hong Kong?”
Chapter 17,“A very great hurry!”
Chapter 17,"“Mr. Fogg, I suppose, is anxious to catch the steamer for Yokohama?”"
Chapter 17,“Terribly anxious.”
Chapter 17,"“You believe in this journey around the world, then?”"
Chapter 17,"“Absolutely. Don’t you, Mr. Fix?”"
Chapter 17,“I? I don’t believe a word of it.”
Chapter 17,"“You’re a sly dog!” said Passepartout, winking at him."
Chapter 17,"This expression rather disturbed Fix, without his knowing why. Had the"
Chapter 17,Frenchman guessed his real purpose? He knew not what to think. But how
Chapter 17,"could Passepartout have discovered that he was a detective? Yet, in"
Chapter 17,"speaking as he did, the man evidently meant more than he expressed."
Chapter 17,Passepartout went still further the next day; he could not hold his
Chapter 17,tongue.
Chapter 17,"“Mr. Fix,” said he, in a bantering tone, “shall we be so unfortunate as"
Chapter 17,to lose you when we get to Hong Kong?”
Chapter 17,"“Why,” responded Fix, a little embarrassed, “I don’t know; perhaps—”"
Chapter 17,"“Ah, if you would only go on with us! An agent of the Peninsular"
Chapter 17,"Company, you know, can’t stop on the way! You were only going to"
Chapter 17,"Bombay, and here you are in China. America is not far off, and from"
Chapter 17,America to Europe is only a step.”
Chapter 17,"Fix looked intently at his companion, whose countenance was as serene"
Chapter 17,"as possible, and laughed with him. But Passepartout persisted in"
Chapter 17,chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation.
Chapter 17,"“Yes, and no,” returned Fix; “there is good and bad luck in such"
Chapter 17,things. But you must understand that I don’t travel at my own expense.”
Chapter 17,"“Oh, I am quite sure of that!” cried Passepartout, laughing heartily."
Chapter 17,"Fix, fairly puzzled, descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his"
Chapter 17,reflections. He was evidently suspected; somehow or other the Frenchman
Chapter 17,had found out that he was a detective. But had he told his master? What
Chapter 17,part was he playing in all this: was he an accomplice or not? Was the
Chapter 17,"game, then, up? Fix spent several hours turning these things over in"
Chapter 17,"his mind, sometimes thinking that all was lost, then persuading himself"
Chapter 17,"that Fogg was ignorant of his presence, and then undecided what course"
Chapter 17,it was best to take.
Chapter 17,"Nevertheless, he preserved his coolness of mind, and at last resolved"
Chapter 17,to deal plainly with Passepartout. If he did not find it practicable to
Chapter 17,"arrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made preparations to leave that"
Chapter 17,"last foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would tell Passepartout"
Chapter 17,"all. Either the servant was the accomplice of his master, and in this"
Chapter 17,"case the master knew of his operations, and he should fail; or else the"
Chapter 17,"servant knew nothing about the robbery, and then his interest would be"
Chapter 17,to abandon the robber.
Chapter 17,Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout. Meanwhile Phileas
Chapter 17,Fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious
Chapter 17,indifference. He was passing methodically in his orbit around the
Chapter 17,"world, regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him. Yet"
Chapter 17,"there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star,"
Chapter 17,which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman’s heart. But
Chapter 17,"no! the charms of Aouda failed to act, to Passepartout’s great"
Chapter 17,"surprise; and the disturbances, if they existed, would have been more"
Chapter 17,difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery
Chapter 17,of Neptune.
Chapter 17,"It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read in"
Chapter 17,"Aouda’s eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master. Phileas Fogg,"
Chapter 17,"though brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite heartless. As to"
Chapter 17,"the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him, there was"
Chapter 17,clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in
Chapter 17,perpetual reveries.
Chapter 17,"One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and was"
Chapter 17,"observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the"
Chapter 17,screw out of the water. The steam came hissing out of the valves; and
Chapter 17,this made Passepartout indignant.
Chapter 17,“The valves are not sufficiently charged!” he exclaimed. “We are not
Chapter 17,"going. Oh, these English! If this was an American craft, we should blow"
Chapter 17,"up, perhaps, but we should at all events go faster!”"
Chapter 18,CHAPTER XVIII.
Chapter 18,"IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG, PASSEPARTOUT, AND FIX GO EACH ABOUT HIS BUSINESS"
Chapter 18,"The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage. The wind,"
Chapter 18,"obstinately remaining in the north-west, blew a gale, and retarded the"
Chapter 18,steamer. The “Rangoon” rolled heavily and the passengers became
Chapter 18,"impatient of the long, monstrous waves which the wind raised before"
Chapter 18,"their path. A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November, the squall"
Chapter 18,"knocking the vessel about with fury, and the waves running high. The"
Chapter 18,"“Rangoon” reefed all her sails, and even the rigging proved too much,"
Chapter 18,whistling and shaking amid the squall. The steamer was forced to
Chapter 18,"proceed slowly, and the captain estimated that she would reach Hong"
Chapter 18,"Kong twenty hours behind time, and more if the storm lasted."
Chapter 18,"Phileas Fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea, which seemed to be"
Chapter 18,"struggling especially to delay him, with his habitual tranquillity. He"
Chapter 18,"never changed countenance for an instant, though a delay of twenty"
Chapter 18,"hours, by making him too late for the Yokohama boat, would almost"
Chapter 18,inevitably cause the loss of the wager. But this man of nerve
Chapter 18,manifested neither impatience nor annoyance; it seemed as if the storm
Chapter 18,"were a part of his programme, and had been foreseen. Aouda was amazed"
Chapter 18,to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him.
Chapter 18,Fix did not look at the state of things in the same light. The storm
Chapter 18,greatly pleased him. His satisfaction would have been complete had the
Chapter 18,“Rangoon” been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves.
Chapter 18,"Each delay filled him with hope, for it became more and more probable"
Chapter 18,that Fogg would be obliged to remain some days at Hong Kong; and now
Chapter 18,"the heavens themselves became his allies, with the gusts and squalls."
Chapter 18,It mattered not that they made him sea-sick—he made no account of this
Chapter 18,"inconvenience; and, whilst his body was writhing under their effects,"
Chapter 18,his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation.
Chapter 18,Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather.
Chapter 18,Everything had gone so well till now! Earth and sea had seemed to be at
Chapter 18,his master’s service; steamers and railways obeyed him; wind and steam
Chapter 18,united to speed his journey. Had the hour of adversity come?
Chapter 18,Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were
Chapter 18,"to come from his own pocket. The storm exasperated him, the gale made"
Chapter 18,"him furious, and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience."
Chapter 18,"Poor fellow! Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction,"
Chapter 18,"for, had he betrayed it, Passepartout could scarcely have restrained"
Chapter 18,himself from personal violence.
Chapter 18,"Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted, being"
Chapter 18,"unable to remain quiet below, and taking it into his head to aid the"
Chapter 18,progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew. He overwhelmed
Chapter 18,"the captain, officers, and sailors, who could not help laughing at his"
Chapter 18,"impatience, with all sorts of questions. He wanted to know exactly how"
Chapter 18,long the storm was going to last; whereupon he was referred to the
Chapter 18,"barometer, which seemed to have no intention of rising. Passepartout"
Chapter 18,"shook it, but with no perceptible effect; for neither shaking nor"
Chapter 18,maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind.
Chapter 18,"On the 4th, however, the sea became more calm, and the storm lessened"
Chapter 18,"its violence; the wind veered southward, and was once more favourable."
Chapter 18,Passepartout cleared up with the weather. Some of the sails were
Chapter 18,"unfurled, and the “Rangoon” resumed its most rapid speed. The time lost"
Chapter 18,"could not, however, be regained. Land was not signalled until five"
Chapter 18,o’clock on the morning of the 6th; the steamer was due on the 5th.
Chapter 18,"Phileas Fogg was twenty-four hours behind-hand, and the Yokohama"
Chapter 18,"steamer would, of course, be missed."
Chapter 18,"The pilot went on board at six, and took his place on the bridge, to"
Chapter 18,guide the “Rangoon” through the channels to the port of Hong Kong.
Chapter 18,Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for Yokohama;
Chapter 18,"but he dared not, for he wished to preserve the spark of hope, which"
Chapter 18,still remained till the last moment. He had confided his anxiety to Fix
Chapter 18,who—the sly rascal!—tried to console him by saying that Mr. Fogg would
Chapter 18,be in time if he took the next boat; but this only put Passepartout in
Chapter 18,a passion.
Chapter 18,"Mr. Fogg, bolder than his servant, did not hesitate to approach the"
Chapter 18,"pilot, and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would leave"
Chapter 18,Hong Kong for Yokohama.
Chapter 18,"“At high tide to-morrow morning,” answered the pilot."
Chapter 18,"“Ah!” said Mr. Fogg, without betraying any astonishment."
Chapter 18,"Passepartout, who heard what passed, would willingly have embraced the"
Chapter 18,"pilot, while Fix would have been glad to twist his neck."
Chapter 18,“What is the steamer’s name?” asked Mr. Fogg.
Chapter 18,“The ‘Carnatic.’”
Chapter 18,“Ought she not to have gone yesterday?”
Chapter 18,"“Yes, sir; but they had to repair one of her boilers, and so her"
Chapter 18,departure was postponed till to-morrow.”
Chapter 18,"“Thank you,” returned Mr. Fogg, descending mathematically to the"
Chapter 18,saloon.
Chapter 18,Passepartout clasped the pilot’s hand and shook it heartily in his
Chapter 18,"delight, exclaiming, “Pilot, you are the best of good fellows!”"
Chapter 18,The pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him
Chapter 18,"this enthusiastic greeting. He remounted the bridge, and guided the"
Chapter 18,"steamer through the flotilla of junks, tankas, and fishing boats which"
Chapter 18,crowd the harbour of Hong Kong.
Chapter 18,"At one o’clock the “Rangoon” was at the quay, and the passengers were"
Chapter 18,going ashore.
Chapter 18,"Chance had strangely favoured Phileas Fogg, for had not the “Carnatic”"
Chapter 18,"been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers, she would have left"
Chapter 18,"on the 6th of November, and the passengers for Japan would have been"
Chapter 18,obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer. Mr. Fogg
Chapter 18,"was, it is true, twenty-four hours behind his time; but this could not"
Chapter 18,seriously imperil the remainder of his tour.
Chapter 18,The steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco
Chapter 18,"made a direct connection with that from Hong Kong, and it could not"
Chapter 18,sail until the latter reached Yokohama; and if Mr. Fogg was twenty-four
Chapter 18,"hours late on reaching Yokohama, this time would no doubt be easily"
Chapter 18,regained in the voyage of twenty-two days across the Pacific. He found
Chapter 18,"himself, then, about twenty-four hours behind-hand, thirty-five days"
Chapter 18,after leaving London.
Chapter 18,The “Carnatic” was announced to leave Hong Kong at five the next
Chapter 18,morning. Mr. Fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his business
Chapter 18,"there, which was to deposit Aouda safely with her wealthy relative."
Chapter 18,"On landing, he conducted her to a palanquin, in which they repaired to"
Chapter 18,"the Club Hotel. A room was engaged for the young woman, and Mr. Fogg,"
Chapter 18,"after seeing that she wanted for nothing, set out in search of her"
Chapter 18,cousin Jeejeeh. He instructed Passepartout to remain at the hotel until
Chapter 18,"his return, that Aouda might not be left entirely alone."
Chapter 18,"Mr. Fogg repaired to the Exchange, where, he did not doubt, every one"
Chapter 18,would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as the Parsee
Chapter 18,"merchant. Meeting a broker, he made the inquiry, to learn that Jeejeeh"
Chapter 18,"had left China two years before, and, retiring from business with an"
Chapter 18,"immense fortune, had taken up his residence in Europe—in Holland the"
Chapter 18,"broker thought, with the merchants of which country he had principally"
Chapter 18,"traded. Phileas Fogg returned to the hotel, begged a moment’s"
Chapter 18,"conversation with Aouda, and without more ado, apprised her that"
Chapter 18,"Jeejeeh was no longer at Hong Kong, but probably in Holland."
Chapter 18,"Aouda at first said nothing. She passed her hand across her forehead,"
Chapter 18,"and reflected a few moments. Then, in her sweet, soft voice, she said:"
Chapter 18,"“What ought I to do, Mr. Fogg?”"
Chapter 18,"“It is very simple,” responded the gentleman. “Go on to Europe.”"
Chapter 18,“But I cannot intrude—”
Chapter 18,"“You do not intrude, nor do you in the least embarrass my project."
Chapter 18,Passepartout!”
Chapter 18,“Monsieur.”
Chapter 18,"“Go to the ‘Carnatic,’ and engage three cabins.”"
Chapter 18,"Passepartout, delighted that the young woman, who was very gracious to"
Chapter 18,"him, was going to continue the journey with them, went off at a brisk"
Chapter 18,gait to obey his master’s order.
Chapter 19,CHAPTER XIX.
Chapter 19,"IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TAKES A TOO GREAT INTEREST IN HIS MASTER, AND"
Chapter 19,WHAT COMES OF IT
Chapter 19,Hong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the English by
Chapter 19,"the Treaty of Nankin, after the war of 1842; and the colonising genius"
Chapter 19,of the English has created upon it an important city and an excellent
Chapter 19,"port. The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River, and is"
Chapter 19,"separated by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao, on"
Chapter 19,the opposite coast. Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the
Chapter 19,"Chinese trade, and now the greater part of the transportation of"
Chapter 19,"Chinese goods finds its depot at the former place. Docks, hospitals,"
Chapter 19,"wharves, a Gothic cathedral, a government house, macadamised streets,"
Chapter 19,give to Hong Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey
Chapter 19,transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes.
Chapter 19,"Passepartout wandered, with his hands in his pockets, towards the"
Chapter 19,"Victoria port, gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other"
Chapter 19,"modes of conveyance, and the groups of Chinese, Japanese, and Europeans"
Chapter 19,who passed to and fro in the streets. Hong Kong seemed to him not
Chapter 19,"unlike Bombay, Calcutta, and Singapore, since, like them, it betrayed"
Chapter 19,everywhere the evidence of English supremacy. At the Victoria port he
Chapter 19,"found a confused mass of ships of all nations: English, French,"
Chapter 19,"American, and Dutch, men-of-war and trading vessels, Japanese and"
Chapter 19,"Chinese junks, sempas, tankas, and flower-boats, which formed so many"
Chapter 19,floating parterres. Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the
Chapter 19,natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow. On going into a
Chapter 19,barber’s to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at
Chapter 19,"least eighty years old, at which age they are permitted to wear yellow,"
Chapter 19,"which is the Imperial colour. Passepartout, without exactly knowing"
Chapter 19,"why, thought this very funny."
Chapter 19,"On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the “Carnatic,” he"
Chapter 19,was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down. The detective
Chapter 19,seemed very much disturbed and disappointed.
Chapter 19,"“This is bad,” muttered Passepartout, “for the gentlemen of the Reform"
Chapter 19,"Club!” He accosted Fix with a merry smile, as if he had not perceived"
Chapter 19,"that gentleman’s chagrin. The detective had, indeed, good reasons to"
Chapter 19,inveigh against the bad luck which pursued him. The warrant had not
Chapter 19,"come! It was certainly on the way, but as certainly it could not now"
Chapter 19,"reach Hong Kong for several days; and, this being the last English"
Chapter 19,"territory on Mr. Fogg’s route, the robber would escape, unless he could"
Chapter 19,manage to detain him.
Chapter 19,"“Well, Monsieur Fix,” said Passepartout, “have you decided to go with"
Chapter 19,us so far as America?”
Chapter 19,"“Yes,” returned Fix, through his set teeth."
Chapter 19,"“Good!” exclaimed Passepartout, laughing heartily. “I knew you could"
Chapter 19,not persuade yourself to separate from us. Come and engage your berth.”
Chapter 19,They entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons.
Chapter 19,"The clerk, as he gave them the tickets, informed them that, the repairs"
Chapter 19,"on the “Carnatic” having been completed, the steamer would leave that"
Chapter 19,"very evening, and not next morning, as had been announced."
Chapter 19,"“That will suit my master all the better,” said Passepartout. “I will"
Chapter 19,go and let him know.”
Chapter 19,Fix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout
Chapter 19,all. It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg
Chapter 19,several days longer at Hong Kong. He accordingly invited his companion
Chapter 19,"into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay. On entering, they found"
Chapter 19,"themselves in a large room handsomely decorated, at the end of which"
Chapter 19,was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions. Several persons lay upon
Chapter 19,this bed in a deep sleep. At the small tables which were arranged about
Chapter 19,"the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer, porter, gin,"
Chapter 19,"and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes stuffed with little"
Chapter 19,balls of opium mingled with essence of rose. From time to time one of
Chapter 19,"the smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip under the table,"
Chapter 19,"whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and feet, carried and"
Chapter 19,laid him upon the bed. The bed already supported twenty of these
Chapter 19,stupefied sots.
Chapter 19,Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by
Chapter 19,"those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures to whom the English"
Chapter 19,"merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium, to the"
Chapter 19,amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds—thousands devoted to
Chapter 19,one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity! The Chinese
Chapter 19,government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent
Chapter 19,"laws. It passed gradually from the rich, to whom it was at first"
Chapter 19,"exclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and then its ravages could"
Chapter 19,"not be arrested. Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and"
Chapter 19,"women, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the victims"
Chapter 19,"cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily"
Chapter 19,contortions and agonies. A great smoker can smoke as many as eight
Chapter 19,pipes a day; but he dies in five years. It was in one of these dens
Chapter 19,"that Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found"
Chapter 19,"themselves. Passepartout had no money, but willingly accepted Fix’s"
Chapter 19,invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time.
Chapter 19,"They ordered two bottles of port, to which the Frenchman did ample"
Chapter 19,"justice, whilst Fix observed him with close attention. They chatted"
Chapter 19,"about the journey, and Passepartout was especially merry at the idea"
Chapter 19,that Fix was going to continue it with them. When the bottles were
Chapter 19,"empty, however, he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the"
Chapter 19,time of the sailing of the “Carnatic.”
Chapter 19,"Fix caught him by the arm, and said, “Wait a moment.”"
Chapter 19,"“What for, Mr. Fix?”"
Chapter 19,“I want to have a serious talk with you.”
Chapter 19,"“A serious talk!” cried Passepartout, drinking up the little wine that"
Chapter 19,"was left in the bottom of his glass. “Well, we’ll talk about it"
Chapter 19,to-morrow; I haven’t time now.”
Chapter 19,“Stay! What I have to say concerns your master.”
Chapter 19,"Passepartout, at this, looked attentively at his companion. Fix’s face"
Chapter 19,seemed to have a singular expression. He resumed his seat.
Chapter 19,“What is it that you have to say?”
Chapter 19,"Fix placed his hand upon Passepartout’s arm, and, lowering his voice,"
Chapter 19,"said, “You have guessed who I am?”"
Chapter 19,"“Parbleu!” said Passepartout, smiling."
Chapter 19,“Then I’m going to tell you everything—”
Chapter 19,"“Now that I know everything, my friend! Ah! that’s very good. But go"
Chapter 19,"on, go on. First, though, let me tell you that those gentlemen have put"
Chapter 19,themselves to a useless expense.”
Chapter 19,“Useless!” said Fix. “You speak confidently. It’s clear that you don’t
Chapter 19,know how large the sum is.”
Chapter 19,"“Of course I do,” returned Passepartout. “Twenty thousand pounds.”"
Chapter 19,"“Fifty-five thousand!” answered Fix, pressing his companion’s hand."
Chapter 19,“What!” cried the Frenchman. “Has Monsieur Fogg dared—fifty-five
Chapter 19,"thousand pounds! Well, there’s all the more reason for not losing an"
Chapter 19,"instant,” he continued, getting up hastily."
Chapter 19,"Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: “Fifty-five"
Chapter 19,"thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds. If you’ll"
Chapter 19,"help me, I’ll let you have five hundred of them.”"
Chapter 19,"“Help you?” cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing wide open."
Chapter 19,“Yes; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days.”
Chapter 19,"“Why, what are you saying? Those gentlemen are not satisfied with"
Chapter 19,"following my master and suspecting his honour, but they must try to put"
Chapter 19,obstacles in his way! I blush for them!”
Chapter 19,“What do you mean?”
Chapter 19,“I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery. They might as well
Chapter 19,waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets!”
Chapter 19,“That’s just what we count on doing.”
Chapter 19,"“It’s a conspiracy, then,” cried Passepartout, who became more and more"
Chapter 19,"excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank without"
Chapter 19,"perceiving it. “A real conspiracy! And gentlemen, too. Bah!”"
Chapter 19,Fix began to be puzzled.
Chapter 19,"“Members of the Reform Club!” continued Passepartout. “You must know,"
Chapter 19,"Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and that, when he makes"
Chapter 19,"a wager, he tries to win it fairly!”"
Chapter 19,"“But who do you think I am?” asked Fix, looking at him intently."
Chapter 19,"“Parbleu! An agent of the members of the Reform Club, sent out here to"
Chapter 19,"interrupt my master’s journey. But, though I found you out some time"
Chapter 19,"ago, I’ve taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg.”"
Chapter 19,"“He knows nothing, then?”"
Chapter 19,"“Nothing,” replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass."
Chapter 19,"The detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before he"
Chapter 19,"spoke again. What should he do? Passepartout’s mistake seemed sincere,"
Chapter 19,but it made his design more difficult. It was evident that the servant
Chapter 19,"was not the master’s accomplice, as Fix had been inclined to suspect."
Chapter 19,"“Well,” said the detective to himself, “as he is not an accomplice, he"
Chapter 19,will help me.”
Chapter 19,"He had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he"
Chapter 19,resolved to make a clean breast of it.
Chapter 19,"“Listen to me,” said Fix abruptly. “I am not, as you think, an agent of"
Chapter 19,the members of the Reform Club—”
Chapter 19,"“Bah!” retorted Passepartout, with an air of raillery."
Chapter 19,"“I am a police detective, sent out here by the London office.”"
Chapter 19,"“You, a detective?”"
Chapter 19,“I will prove it. Here is my commission.”
Chapter 19,Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this
Chapter 19,"document, the genuineness of which could not be doubted."
Chapter 19,"“Mr. Fogg’s wager,” resumed Fix, “is only a pretext, of which you and"
Chapter 19,the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes. He had a motive for securing
Chapter 19,your innocent complicity.”
Chapter 19,“But why?”
Chapter 19,“Listen. On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand
Chapter 19,pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose
Chapter 19,description was fortunately secured. Here is his description; it
Chapter 19,answers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg.”
Chapter 19,"“What nonsense!” cried Passepartout, striking the table with his fist."
Chapter 19,“My master is the most honourable of men!”
Chapter 19,“How can you tell? You know scarcely anything about him. You went into
Chapter 19,his service the day he came away; and he came away on a foolish
Chapter 19,"pretext, without trunks, and carrying a large amount in banknotes. And"
Chapter 19,yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man!”
Chapter 19,"“Yes, yes,” repeated the poor fellow, mechanically."
Chapter 19,“Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?”
Chapter 19,"Passepartout, overcome by what he had heard, held his head between his"
Chapter 19,"hands, and did not dare to look at the detective. Phileas Fogg, the"
Chapter 19,"saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man, a robber! And yet how"
Chapter 19,many presumptions there were against him! Passepartout essayed to
Chapter 19,reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not
Chapter 19,wish to believe that his master was guilty.
Chapter 19,"“Well, what do you want of me?” said he, at last, with an effort."
Chapter 19,"“See here,” replied Fix; “I have tracked Mr. Fogg to this place, but as"
Chapter 19,yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to
Chapter 19,London. You must help me to keep him here in Hong Kong—”
Chapter 19,“I! But I—”
Chapter 19,“I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the
Chapter 19,Bank of England.”
Chapter 19,"“Never!” replied Passepartout, who tried to rise, but fell back,"
Chapter 19,exhausted in mind and body.
Chapter 19,"“Mr. Fix,” he stammered, “even should what you say be true—if my master"
Chapter 19,"is really the robber you are seeking for—which I deny—I have been, am,"
Chapter 19,in his service; I have seen his generosity and goodness; and I will
Chapter 19,never betray him—not for all the gold in the world. I come from a
Chapter 19,village where they don’t eat that kind of bread!”
Chapter 19,“You refuse?”
Chapter 19,“I refuse.”
Chapter 19,"“Consider that I’ve said nothing,” said Fix; “and let us drink.”"
Chapter 19,“Yes; let us drink!”
Chapter 19,Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the
Chapter 19,"liquor. Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be separated from his"
Chapter 19,"master, wished to entirely overcome him. Some pipes full of opium lay"
Chapter 19,"upon the table. Fix slipped one into Passepartout’s hand. He took it,"
Chapter 19,"put it between his lips, lit it, drew several puffs, and his head,"
Chapter 19,"becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic, fell upon the"
Chapter 19,table.
Chapter 19,"“At last!” said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious. “Mr. Fogg will"
Chapter 19,"not be informed of the ‘Carnatic’s’ departure; and, if he is, he will"
Chapter 19,have to go without this cursed Frenchman!”
Chapter 19,"And, after paying his bill, Fix left the tavern."
Chapter 20,CHAPTER XX.
Chapter 20,IN WHICH FIX COMES FACE TO FACE WITH PHILEAS FOGG
Chapter 20,"While these events were passing at the opium-house, Mr. Fogg,"
Chapter 20,"unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer, was quietly"
Chapter 20,"escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter, making the"
Chapter 20,necessary purchases for the long voyage before them. It was all very
Chapter 20,well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with
Chapter 20,a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under
Chapter 20,"such conditions. He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity,"
Chapter 20,"and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion, who"
Chapter 20,was confused by his patience and generosity:
Chapter 20,“It is in the interest of my journey—a part of my programme.”
Chapter 20,"The purchases made, they returned to the hotel, where they dined at a"
Chapter 20,"sumptuously served _table-d’hôte;_ after which Aouda, shaking hands"
Chapter 20,"with her protector after the English fashion, retired to her room for"
Chapter 20,rest. Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal
Chapter 20,of the _Times_ and _Illustrated London News_.
Chapter 20,"Had he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would have been"
Chapter 20,"not to see his servant return at bedtime. But, knowing that the steamer"
Chapter 20,"was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning, he did not"
Chapter 20,disturb himself about the matter. When Passepartout did not appear the
Chapter 20,"next morning to answer his master’s bell, Mr. Fogg, not betraying the"
Chapter 20,"least vexation, contented himself with taking his carpet-bag, calling"
Chapter 20,"Aouda, and sending for a palanquin."
Chapter 20,"It was then eight o’clock; at half-past nine, it being then high tide,"
Chapter 20,the “Carnatic” would leave the harbour. Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the
Chapter 20,"palanquin, their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow, and half"
Chapter 20,an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark. Mr.
Chapter 20,Fogg then learned that the “Carnatic” had sailed the evening before. He
Chapter 20,"had expected to find not only the steamer, but his domestic, and was"
Chapter 20,forced to give up both; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his
Chapter 20,"face, and he merely remarked to Aouda, “It is an accident, madam;"
Chapter 20,nothing more.”
Chapter 20,At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached.
Chapter 20,"It was Fix, who, bowing, addressed Mr. Fogg: “Were you not, like me,"
Chapter 20,"sir, a passenger by the ‘Rangoon,’ which arrived yesterday?”"
Chapter 20,"“I was, sir,” replied Mr. Fogg coldly. “But I have not the honour—”"
Chapter 20,“Pardon me; I thought I should find your servant here.”
Chapter 20,"“Do you know where he is, sir?” asked Aouda anxiously."
Chapter 20,"“What!” responded Fix, feigning surprise. “Is he not with you?”"
Chapter 20,"“No,” said Aouda. “He has not made his appearance since yesterday."
Chapter 20,Could he have gone on board the ‘Carnatic’ without us?”
Chapter 20,"“Without you, madam?” answered the detective. “Excuse me, did you"
Chapter 20,intend to sail in the ‘Carnatic’?”
Chapter 20,"“Yes, sir.”"
Chapter 20,"“So did I, madam, and I am excessively disappointed. The ‘Carnatic’,"
Chapter 20,"its repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve hours before the"
Chapter 20,"stated time, without any notice being given; and we must now wait a"
Chapter 20,week for another steamer.”
Chapter 20,As he said “a week” Fix felt his heart leap for joy. Fogg detained at
Chapter 20,"Hong Kong for a week! There would be time for the warrant to arrive,"
Chapter 20,and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law. His horror
Chapter 20,"may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg say, in his placid voice, “But"
Chapter 20,"there are other vessels besides the ‘Carnatic,’ it seems to me, in the"
Chapter 20,harbour of Hong Kong.”
Chapter 20,"And, offering his arm to Aouda, he directed his steps toward the docks"
Chapter 20,"in search of some craft about to start. Fix, stupefied, followed; it"
Chapter 20,seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an invisible thread.
Chapter 20,"Chance, however, appeared really to have abandoned the man it had"
Chapter 20,hitherto served so well. For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about
Chapter 20,"the docks, with the determination, if necessary, to charter a vessel to"
Chapter 20,carry him to Yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were
Chapter 20,"loading or unloading, and which could not therefore set sail. Fix began"
Chapter 20,to hope again.
Chapter 20,"But Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his search,"
Chapter 20,"resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when he was accosted"
Chapter 20,by a sailor on one of the wharves.
Chapter 20,“Is your honour looking for a boat?”
Chapter 20,“Have you a boat ready to sail?”
Chapter 20,"“Yes, your honour; a pilot-boat—No. 43—the best in the harbour.”"
Chapter 20,“Does she go fast?”
Chapter 20,“Between eight and nine knots the hour. Will you look at her?”
Chapter 20,“Yes.”
Chapter 20,“Your honour will be satisfied with her. Is it for a sea excursion?”
Chapter 20,“No; for a voyage.”
Chapter 20,“A voyage?”
Chapter 20,"“Yes, will you agree to take me to Yokohama?”"
Chapter 20,"The sailor leaned on the railing, opened his eyes wide, and said, “Is"
Chapter 20,your honour joking?”
Chapter 20,"“No. I have missed the ‘Carnatic,’ and I must get to Yokohama by the"
Chapter 20,"14th at the latest, to take the boat for San Francisco.”"
Chapter 20,"“I am sorry,” said the sailor; “but it is impossible.”"
Chapter 20,"“I offer you a hundred pounds per day, and an additional reward of two"
Chapter 20,hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time.”
Chapter 20,“Are you in earnest?”
Chapter 20,“Very much so.”
Chapter 20,"The pilot walked away a little distance, and gazed out to sea,"
Chapter 20,evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the
Chapter 20,fear of venturing so far. Fix was in mortal suspense.
Chapter 20,"Mr. Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her, “You would not be afraid, would"
Chapter 20,"you, madam?”"
Chapter 20,"“Not with you, Mr. Fogg,” was her answer."
Chapter 20,"The pilot now returned, shuffling his hat in his hands."
Chapter 20,"“Well, pilot?” said Mr. Fogg."
Chapter 20,"“Well, your honour,” replied he, “I could not risk myself, my men, or"
Chapter 20,my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time
Chapter 20,"of year. Besides, we could not reach Yokohama in time, for it is"
Chapter 20,sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong.”
Chapter 20,"“Only sixteen hundred,” said Mr. Fogg."
Chapter 20,“It’s the same thing.”
Chapter 20,Fix breathed more freely.
Chapter 20,"“But,” added the pilot, “it might be arranged another way.”"
Chapter 20,Fix ceased to breathe at all.
Chapter 20,“How?” asked Mr. Fogg.
Chapter 20,"“By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to"
Chapter 20,"Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here. In going to"
Chapter 20,"Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast,"
Chapter 20,"which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and"
Chapter 20,would aid us.”
Chapter 20,"“Pilot,” said Mr. Fogg, “I must take the American steamer at Yokohama,"
Chapter 20,and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki.”
Chapter 20,“Why not?” returned the pilot. “The San Francisco steamer does not
Chapter 20,"start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it starts"
Chapter 20,from Shanghai.”
Chapter 20,“You are sure of that?”
Chapter 20,“Perfectly.”
Chapter 20,“And when does the boat leave Shanghai?”
Chapter 20,"“On the 11th, at seven in the evening. We have, therefore, four days"
Chapter 20,"before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good"
Chapter 20,"luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those"
Chapter 20,eight hundred miles to Shanghai.”
Chapter 20,“And you could go—”
Chapter 20,“In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails
Chapter 20,put up.”
Chapter 20,“It is a bargain. Are you the master of the boat?”
Chapter 20,"“Yes; John Bunsby, master of the ‘Tankadere.’”"
Chapter 20,“Would you like some earnest-money?”
Chapter 20,“If it would not put your honour out—”
Chapter 20,"“Here are two hundred pounds on account sir,” added Phileas Fogg,"
Chapter 20,"turning to Fix, “if you would like to take advantage—”"
Chapter 20,"“Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour.”"
Chapter 20,“Very well. In half an hour we shall go on board.”
Chapter 20,"“But poor Passepartout?” urged Aouda, who was much disturbed by the"
Chapter 20,servant’s disappearance.
Chapter 20,"“I shall do all I can to find him,” replied Phileas Fogg."
Chapter 20,"While Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat,"
Chapter 20,the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong.
Chapter 20,"Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout’s description, and left a sum of"
Chapter 20,money to be spent in the search for him. The same formalities having
Chapter 20,"been gone through at the French consulate, and the palanquin having"
Chapter 20,"stopped at the hotel for the luggage, which had been sent back there,"
Chapter 20,they returned to the wharf.
Chapter 20,"It was now three o’clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew on"
Chapter 20,"board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure."
Chapter 20,"The “Tankadere” was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully"
Chapter 20,"built as if she were a racing yacht. Her shining copper sheathing, her"
Chapter 20,"galvanised iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the pride"
Chapter 20,taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable. Her two masts leaned a
Chapter 20,"trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and"
Chapter 20,"standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she"
Chapter 20,"seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by"
Chapter 20,gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races. The crew of the “Tankadere”
Chapter 20,"was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who"
Chapter 20,"were familiar with the Chinese seas. John Bunsby, himself, a man of"
Chapter 20,"forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly"
Chapter 20,"expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance,"
Chapter 20,would have inspired confidence in the most timid.
Chapter 20,"Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already"
Chapter 20,"installed. Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged out"
Chapter 20,"in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a table"
Chapter 20,"provided with a swinging lamp. The accommodation was confined, but"
Chapter 20,neat.
Chapter 20,"“I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you,” said Mr. Fogg to Fix,"
Chapter 20,who bowed without responding.
Chapter 20,The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the
Chapter 20,kindness of Mr. Fogg.
Chapter 20,"“It’s certain,” thought he, “though rascal as he is, he is a polite"
Chapter 20,one!”
Chapter 20,The sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three.
Chapter 20,"Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last glance at the"
Chapter 20,"quay, in the hope of espying Passepartout. Fix was not without his"
Chapter 20,"fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant,"
Chapter 20,"whom he had so badly treated, in this direction; in which case an"
Chapter 20,explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have
Chapter 20,"ensued. But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still"
Chapter 20,lying under the stupefying influence of the opium.
Chapter 20,"John Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the"
Chapter 20,"“Tankadere,” taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail, and"
Chapter 20,"standing-jib, bounded briskly forward over the waves."
Chapter 21,CHAPTER XXI.
Chapter 21,IN WHICH THE MASTER OF THE “TANKADERE” RUNS GREAT RISK OF LOSING A
Chapter 21,REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS
Chapter 21,This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of
Chapter 21,"twenty tons, and at that season of the year. The Chinese seas are"
Chapter 21,"usually boisterous, subject to terrible gales of wind, and especially"
Chapter 21,during the equinoxes; and it was now early November.
Chapter 21,It would clearly have been to the master’s advantage to carry his
Chapter 21,"passengers to Yokohama, since he was paid a certain sum per day; but he"
Chapter 21,"would have been rash to attempt such a voyage, and it was imprudent"
Chapter 21,even to attempt to reach Shanghai. But John Bunsby believed in the
Chapter 21,"“Tankadere,” which rode on the waves like a seagull; and perhaps he was"
Chapter 21,not wrong.
Chapter 21,Late in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong
Chapter 21,"Kong, and the “Tankadere,” impelled by favourable winds, conducted"
Chapter 21,herself admirably.
Chapter 21,"“I do not need, pilot,” said Phileas Fogg, when they got into the open"
Chapter 21,"sea, “to advise you to use all possible speed.”"
Chapter 21,"“Trust me, your honour. We are carrying all the sail the wind will let"
Chapter 21,"us. The poles would add nothing, and are only used when we are going"
Chapter 21,into port.”
Chapter 21,"“It’s your trade, not mine, pilot, and I confide in you.”"
Chapter 21,"Phileas Fogg, with body erect and legs wide apart, standing like a"
Chapter 21,"sailor, gazed without staggering at the swelling waters. The young"
Chapter 21,"woman, who was seated aft, was profoundly affected as she looked out"
Chapter 21,"upon the ocean, darkening now with the twilight, on which she had"
Chapter 21,"ventured in so frail a vessel. Above her head rustled the white sails,"
Chapter 21,"which seemed like great white wings. The boat, carried forward by the"
Chapter 21,"wind, seemed to be flying in the air."
Chapter 21,"Night came. The moon was entering her first quarter, and her"
Chapter 21,insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon.
Chapter 21,"Clouds were rising from the east, and already overcast a part of the"
Chapter 21,heavens.
Chapter 21,"The pilot had hung out his lights, which was very necessary in these"
Chapter 21,seas crowded with vessels bound landward; for collisions are not
Chapter 21,"uncommon occurrences, and, at the speed she was going, the least shock"
Chapter 21,would shatter the gallant little craft.
Chapter 21,"Fix, seated in the bow, gave himself up to meditation. He kept apart"
Chapter 21,"from his fellow-travellers, knowing Mr. Fogg’s taciturn tastes;"
Chapter 21,"besides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had"
Chapter 21,"accepted. He was thinking, too, of the future. It seemed certain that"
Chapter 21,"Fogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would at once take the boat for"
Chapter 21,San Francisco; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity
Chapter 21,and safety. Fogg’s plan appeared to him the simplest in the world.
Chapter 21,"Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a"
Chapter 21,"common villain, he had traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to"
Chapter 21,"gain the American continent more surely; and there, after throwing the"
Chapter 21,"police off his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune"
Chapter 21,"stolen from the bank. But, once in the United States, what should he,"
Chapter 21,"Fix, do? Should he abandon this man? No, a hundred times no! Until he"
Chapter 21,"had secured his extradition, he would not lose sight of him for an"
Chapter 21,"hour. It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end. At all"
Chapter 21,"events, there was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout was not"
Chapter 21,"with his master; and it was above all important, after the confidences"
Chapter 21,"Fix had imparted to him, that the servant should never have speech with"
Chapter 21,his master.
Chapter 21,"Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely"
Chapter 21,"disappeared. Looking at the matter from every point of view, it did not"
Chapter 21,"seem to him impossible that, by some mistake, the man might have"
Chapter 21,embarked on the “Carnatic” at the last moment; and this was also
Chapter 21,"Aouda’s opinion, who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow"
Chapter 21,"to whom she owed so much. They might then find him at Yokohama; for, if"
Chapter 21,"the “Carnatic” was carrying him thither, it would be easy to ascertain"
Chapter 21,if he had been on board.
Chapter 21,"A brisk breeze arose about ten o’clock; but, though it might have been"
Chapter 21,"prudent to take in a reef, the pilot, after carefully examining the"
Chapter 21,"heavens, let the craft remain rigged as before. The “Tankadere” bore"
Chapter 21,"sail admirably, as she drew a great deal of water, and everything was"
Chapter 21,prepared for high speed in case of a gale.
Chapter 21,"Mr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight, having been"
Chapter 21,"already preceded by Fix, who had lain down on one of the cots. The"
Chapter 21,pilot and crew remained on deck all night.
Chapter 21,"At sunrise the next day, which was 8th November, the boat had made more"
Chapter 21,than one hundred miles. The log indicated a mean speed of between eight
Chapter 21,"and nine miles. The “Tankadere” still carried all sail, and was"
Chapter 21,accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed. If the wind held as it
Chapter 21,"was, the chances would be in her favour. During the day she kept along"
Chapter 21,"the coast, where the currents were favourable; the coast, irregular in"
Chapter 21,"profile, and visible sometimes across the clearings, was at most five"
Chapter 21,"miles distant. The sea was less boisterous, since the wind came off"
Chapter 21,"land—a fortunate circumstance for the boat, which would suffer, owing"
Chapter 21,"to its small tonnage, by a heavy surge on the sea."
Chapter 21,"The breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from the"
Chapter 21,"south-west. The pilot put up his poles, but took them down again within"
Chapter 21,"two hours, as the wind freshened up anew."
Chapter 21,"Mr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea, ate"
Chapter 21,"with a good appetite, Fix being invited to share their repast, which he"
Chapter 21,accepted with secret chagrin. To travel at this man’s expense and live
Chapter 21,"upon his provisions was not palatable to him. Still, he was obliged to"
Chapter 21,"eat, and so he ate."
Chapter 21,"When the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, “sir”—this"
Chapter 21,"“sir” scorched his lips, and he had to control himself to avoid"
Chapter 21,"collaring this “gentleman”—“sir, you have been very kind to give me a"
Chapter 21,"passage on this boat. But, though my means will not admit of my"
Chapter 21,"expending them as freely as you, I must ask to pay my share—”"
Chapter 21,"“Let us not speak of that, sir,” replied Mr. Fogg."
Chapter 21,"“But, if I insist—”"
Chapter 21,"“No, sir,” repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did not admit of a reply."
Chapter 21,“This enters into my general expenses.”
Chapter 21,"Fix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, where he"
Chapter 21,"ensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest of the day."
Chapter 21,"Meanwhile they were progressing famously, and John Bunsby was in high"
Chapter 21,hope. He several times assured Mr. Fogg that they would reach Shanghai
Chapter 21,in time; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it. The
Chapter 21,"crew set to work in good earnest, inspired by the reward to be gained."
Chapter 21,"There was not a sheet which was not tightened, not a sail which was not"
Chapter 21,vigorously hoisted; not a lurch could be charged to the man at the
Chapter 21,helm. They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a Royal
Chapter 21,yacht regatta.
Chapter 21,"By evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been"
Chapter 21,"accomplished from Hong Kong, and Mr. Fogg might hope that he would be"
Chapter 21,able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his journal; in
Chapter 21,"which case, the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he"
Chapter 21,left London would not seriously affect his journey.
Chapter 21,"The “Tankadere” entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the"
Chapter 21,"island of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of the"
Chapter 21,"night, and crossed the Tropic of Cancer. The sea was very rough in the"
Chapter 21,"straits, full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, and the"
Chapter 21,"chopping waves broke her course, whilst it became very difficult to"
Chapter 21,stand on deck.
Chapter 21,"At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed"
Chapter 21,"to predict a gale. The barometer announced a speedy change, the mercury"
Chapter 21,"rising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in the south-east,"
Chapter 21,raised long surges which indicated a tempest. The sun had set the
Chapter 21,"evening before in a red mist, in the midst of the phosphorescent"
Chapter 21,scintillations of the ocean.
Chapter 21,"John Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens,"
Chapter 21,muttering indistinctly between his teeth. At last he said in a low
Chapter 21,"voice to Mr. Fogg, “Shall I speak out to your honour?”"
Chapter 21,“Of course.”
Chapter 21,"“Well, we are going to have a squall.”"
Chapter 21,“Is the wind north or south?” asked Mr. Fogg quietly.
Chapter 21,“South. Look! a typhoon is coming up.”
Chapter 21,"“Glad it’s a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us forward.”"
Chapter 21,"“Oh, if you take it that way,” said John Bunsby, “I’ve nothing more to"
Chapter 21,say.” John Bunsby’s suspicions were confirmed. At a less advanced
Chapter 21,"season of the year the typhoon, according to a famous meteorologist,"
Chapter 21,would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame; but
Chapter 21,in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them
Chapter 21,with great violence.
Chapter 21,"The pilot took his precautions in advance. He reefed all sail, the"
Chapter 21,pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to the bows. A
Chapter 21,"single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted as a storm-jib,"
Chapter 21,so as to hold the wind from behind. Then they waited.
Chapter 21,John Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this
Chapter 21,"imprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and the boat"
Chapter 21,"bouncing in the gale, was far from pleasant. Neither Mr. Fogg, Fix, nor"
Chapter 21,Aouda consented to leave the deck.
Chapter 21,The storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o’clock.
Chapter 21,"With but its bit of sail, the “Tankadere” was lifted like a feather by"
Chapter 21,"a wind, an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given. To compare her"
Chapter 21,speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be
Chapter 21,below the truth.
Chapter 21,"The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne on by"
Chapter 21,"monstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed equal to"
Chapter 21,theirs. Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these
Chapter 21,mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of
Chapter 21,"the pilot saved her. The passengers were often bathed in spray, but"
Chapter 21,"they submitted to it philosophically. Fix cursed it, no doubt; but"
Chapter 21,"Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, whose coolness amazed"
Chapter 21,"her, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely weathered the storm. As"
Chapter 21,"for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his"
Chapter 21,programme.
Chapter 21,Up to this time the “Tankadere” had always held her course to the
Chapter 21,"north; but towards evening the wind, veering three quarters, bore down"
Chapter 21,"from the north-west. The boat, now lying in the trough of the waves,"
Chapter 21,shook and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with fearful violence. At
Chapter 21,night the tempest increased in violence. John Bunsby saw the approach
Chapter 21,of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings. He
Chapter 21,"thought awhile, and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken"
Chapter 21,"speed. After a consultation he approached Mr. Fogg, and said, “I think,"
Chapter 21,"your honour, that we should do well to make for one of the ports on the"
Chapter 21,coast.”
Chapter 21,“I think so too.”
Chapter 21,“Ah!” said the pilot. “But which one?”
Chapter 21,"“I know of but one,” returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly."
Chapter 21,“And that is—”
Chapter 21,“Shanghai.”
Chapter 21,"The pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely"
Chapter 21,"realise so much determination and tenacity. Then he cried, “Well—yes!"
Chapter 21,Your honour is right. To Shanghai!”
Chapter 21,So the “Tankadere” kept steadily on her northward track.
Chapter 21,The night was really terrible; it would be a miracle if the craft did
Chapter 21,not founder. Twice it could have been all over with her if the crew had
Chapter 21,"not been constantly on the watch. Aouda was exhausted, but did not"
Chapter 21,utter a complaint. More than once Mr. Fogg rushed to protect her from
Chapter 21,the violence of the waves.
Chapter 21,Day reappeared. The tempest still raged with undiminished fury; but the
Chapter 21,"wind now returned to the south-east. It was a favourable change, and"
Chapter 21,"the “Tankadere” again bounded forward on this mountainous sea, though"
Chapter 21,"the waves crossed each other, and imparted shocks and counter-shocks"
Chapter 21,which would have crushed a craft less solidly built. From time to time
Chapter 21,"the coast was visible through the broken mist, but no vessel was in"
Chapter 21,sight. The “Tankadere” was alone upon the sea.
Chapter 21,"There were some signs of a calm at noon, and these became more distinct"
Chapter 21,as the sun descended toward the horizon. The tempest had been as brief
Chapter 21,"as terrific. The passengers, thoroughly exhausted, could now eat a"
Chapter 21,"little, and take some repose."
Chapter 21,The night was comparatively quiet. Some of the sails were again
Chapter 21,"hoisted, and the speed of the boat was very good. The next morning at"
Chapter 21,"dawn they espied the coast, and John Bunsby was able to assert that"
Chapter 21,"they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai. A hundred miles, and"
Chapter 21,only one day to traverse them! That very evening Mr. Fogg was due at
Chapter 21,"Shanghai, if he did not wish to miss the steamer to Yokohama. Had there"
Chapter 21,"been no storm, during which several hours were lost, they would be at"
Chapter 21,this moment within thirty miles of their destination.
Chapter 21,"The wind grew decidedly calmer, and happily the sea fell with it. All"
Chapter 21,"sails were now hoisted, and at noon the “Tankadere” was within"
Chapter 21,forty-five miles of Shanghai. There remained yet six hours in which to
Chapter 21,accomplish that distance. All on board feared that it could not be
Chapter 21,"done, and every one—Phileas Fogg, no doubt, excepted—felt his heart"
Chapter 21,beat with impatience. The boat must keep up an average of nine miles an
Chapter 21,"hour, and the wind was becoming calmer every moment! It was a"
Chapter 21,"capricious breeze, coming from the coast, and after it passed the sea"
Chapter 21,"became smooth. Still, the “Tankadere” was so light, and her fine sails"
Chapter 21,"caught the fickle zephyrs so well, that, with the aid of the currents"
Chapter 21,John Bunsby found himself at six o’clock not more than ten miles from
Chapter 21,the mouth of Shanghai River. Shanghai itself is situated at least
Chapter 21,twelve miles up the stream. At seven they were still three miles from
Chapter 21,Shanghai. The pilot swore an angry oath; the reward of two hundred
Chapter 21,pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him. He looked at Mr.
Chapter 21,Fogg. Mr. Fogg was perfectly tranquil; and yet his whole fortune was at
Chapter 21,this moment at stake.
Chapter 21,"At this moment, also, a long black funnel, crowned with wreaths of"
Chapter 21,"smoke, appeared on the edge of the waters. It was the American steamer,"
Chapter 21,leaving for Yokohama at the appointed time.
Chapter 21,"“Confound her!” cried John Bunsby, pushing back the rudder with a"
Chapter 21,desperate jerk.
Chapter 21,“Signal her!” said Phileas Fogg quietly.
Chapter 21,"A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the “Tankadere,” for"
Chapter 21,making signals in the fogs. It was loaded to the muzzle; but just as
Chapter 21,"the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole, Mr. Fogg"
Chapter 21,"said, “Hoist your flag!”"
Chapter 21,"The flag was run up at half-mast, and, this being the signal of"
Chapter 21,"distress, it was hoped that the American steamer, perceiving it, would"
Chapter 21,"change her course a little, so as to succour the pilot-boat."
Chapter 21,“Fire!” said Mr. Fogg. And the booming of the little cannon resounded
Chapter 21,in the air.
Chapter 22,CHAPTER XXII.
Chapter 22,"IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT FINDS OUT THAT, EVEN AT THE ANTIPODES, IT IS"
Chapter 22,CONVENIENT TO HAVE SOME MONEY IN ONE’S POCKET
Chapter 22,"The “Carnatic,” setting sail from Hong Kong at half-past six on the 7th"
Chapter 22,"of November, directed her course at full steam towards Japan. She"
Chapter 22,carried a large cargo and a well-filled cabin of passengers. Two
Chapter 22,"state-rooms in the rear were, however, unoccupied—those which had been"
Chapter 22,engaged by Phileas Fogg.
Chapter 22,"The next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye, staggering gait,"
Chapter 22,"and disordered hair, was seen to emerge from the second cabin, and to"
Chapter 22,totter to a seat on deck.
Chapter 22,It was Passepartout; and what had happened to him was as follows:
Chapter 22,"Shortly after Fix left the opium den, two waiters had lifted the"
Chapter 22,"unconscious Passepartout, and had carried him to the bed reserved for"
Chapter 22,"the smokers. Three hours later, pursued even in his dreams by a fixed"
Chapter 22,"idea, the poor fellow awoke, and struggled against the stupefying"
Chapter 22,influence of the narcotic. The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off
Chapter 22,"his torpor, and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness. Staggering"
Chapter 22,"and holding himself up by keeping against the walls, falling down and"
Chapter 22,"creeping up again, and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct, he"
Chapter 22,"kept crying out, “The ‘Carnatic!’ the ‘Carnatic!’”"
Chapter 22,"The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay, on the point of starting."
Chapter 22,"Passepartout had but few steps to go; and, rushing upon the plank, he"
Chapter 22,"crossed it, and fell unconscious on the deck, just as the “Carnatic”"
Chapter 22,"was moving off. Several sailors, who were evidently accustomed to this"
Chapter 22,"sort of scene, carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin,"
Chapter 22,and Passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty
Chapter 22,miles away from China. Thus he found himself the next morning on the
Chapter 22,"deck of the “Carnatic,” and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating"
Chapter 22,"sea-breeze. The pure air sobered him. He began to collect his sense,"
Chapter 22,which he found a difficult task; but at last he recalled the events of
Chapter 22,"the evening before, Fix’s revelation, and the opium-house."
Chapter 22,"“It is evident,” said he to himself, “that I have been abominably"
Chapter 22,"drunk! What will Mr. Fogg say? At least I have not missed the steamer,"
Chapter 22,which is the most important thing.”
Chapter 22,"Then, as Fix occurred to him: “As for that rascal, I hope we are well"
Chapter 22,"rid of him, and that he has not dared, as he proposed, to follow us on"
Chapter 22,"board the “Carnatic.” A detective on the track of Mr. Fogg, accused of"
Chapter 22,robbing the Bank of England! Pshaw! Mr. Fogg is no more a robber than I
Chapter 22,am a murderer.”
Chapter 22,Should he divulge Fix’s real errand to his master? Would it do to tell
Chapter 22,the part the detective was playing? Would it not be better to wait
Chapter 22,"until Mr. Fogg reached London again, and then impart to him that an"
Chapter 22,agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the
Chapter 22,"world, and have a good laugh over it? No doubt; at least, it was worth"
Chapter 22,"considering. The first thing to do was to find Mr. Fogg, and apologise"
Chapter 22,for his singular behaviour.
Chapter 22,"Passepartout got up and proceeded, as well as he could with the rolling"
Chapter 22,"of the steamer, to the after-deck. He saw no one who resembled either"
Chapter 22,"his master or Aouda. “Good!” muttered he; “Aouda has not got up yet,"
Chapter 22,and Mr. Fogg has probably found some partners at whist.”
Chapter 22,He descended to the saloon. Mr. Fogg was not there. Passepartout had
Chapter 22,"only, however, to ask the purser the number of his master’s state-room."
Chapter 22,The purser replied that he did not know any passenger by the name of
Chapter 22,Fogg.
Chapter 22,"“I beg your pardon,” said Passepartout persistently. “He is a tall"
Chapter 22,"gentleman, quiet, and not very talkative, and has with him a young"
Chapter 22,lady—”
Chapter 22,"“There is no young lady on board,” interrupted the purser. “Here is a"
Chapter 22,list of the passengers; you may see for yourself.”
Chapter 22,"Passepartout scanned the list, but his master’s name was not upon it."
Chapter 22,All at once an idea struck him.
Chapter 22,“Ah! am I on the ‘Carnatic?’”
Chapter 22,“Yes.”
Chapter 22,“On the way to Yokohama?”
Chapter 22,“Certainly.”
Chapter 22,Passepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boat;
Chapter 22,"but, though he was really on the “Carnatic,” his master was not there."
Chapter 22,He fell thunderstruck on a seat. He saw it all now. He remembered that
Chapter 22,"the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have informed his"
Chapter 22,"master of that fact, and that he had not done so. It was his fault,"
Chapter 22,"then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer. Yes, but it was"
Chapter 22,"still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate him from"
Chapter 22,"his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled him into"
Chapter 22,getting drunk! He now saw the detective’s trick; and at this moment Mr.
Chapter 22,"Fogg was certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself perhaps"
Chapter 22,arrested and imprisoned! At this thought Passepartout tore his hair.
Chapter 22,"Ah, if Fix ever came within his reach, what a settling of accounts"
Chapter 22,there would be!
Chapter 22,"After his first depression, Passepartout became calmer, and began to"
Chapter 22,study his situation. It was certainly not an enviable one. He found
Chapter 22,"himself on the way to Japan, and what should he do when he got there?"
Chapter 22,"His pocket was empty; he had not a solitary shilling, not so much as a"
Chapter 22,penny. His passage had fortunately been paid for in advance; and he had
Chapter 22,five or six days in which to decide upon his future course. He fell to
Chapter 22,"at meals with an appetite, and ate for Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and himself. He"
Chapter 22,"helped himself as generously as if Japan were a desert, where nothing"
Chapter 22,to eat was to be looked for.
Chapter 22,At dawn on the 13th the “Carnatic” entered the port of Yokohama. This
Chapter 22,"is an important port of call in the Pacific, where all the"
Chapter 22,"mail-steamers, and those carrying travellers between North America,"
Chapter 22,"China, Japan, and the Oriental islands put in. It is situated in the"
Chapter 22,"bay of Yeddo, and at but a short distance from that second capital of"
Chapter 22,"the Japanese Empire, and the residence of the Tycoon, the civil"
Chapter 22,"Emperor, before the Mikado, the spiritual Emperor, absorbed his office"
Chapter 22,"in his own. The “Carnatic” anchored at the quay near the custom-house,"
Chapter 22,in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations.
Chapter 22,Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the
Chapter 22,"Sons of the Sun. He had nothing better to do than, taking chance for"
Chapter 22,"his guide, to wander aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama. He"
Chapter 22,"found himself at first in a thoroughly European quarter, the houses"
Chapter 22,"having low fronts, and being adorned with verandas, beneath which he"
Chapter 22,"caught glimpses of neat peristyles. This quarter occupied, with its"
Chapter 22,"streets, squares, docks, and warehouses, all the space between the"
Chapter 22,"“promontory of the Treaty” and the river. Here, as at Hong Kong and"
Chapter 22,"Calcutta, were mixed crowds of all races, Americans and English,"
Chapter 22,"Chinamen and Dutchmen, mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything."
Chapter 22,The Frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had
Chapter 22,dropped down in the midst of Hottentots.
Chapter 22,"He had, at least, one resource,—to call on the French and English"
Chapter 22,consuls at Yokohama for assistance. But he shrank from telling the
Chapter 22,"story of his adventures, intimately connected as it was with that of"
Chapter 22,"his master; and, before doing so, he determined to exhaust all other"
Chapter 22,"means of aid. As chance did not favour him in the European quarter, he"
Chapter 22,"penetrated that inhabited by the native Japanese, determined, if"
Chapter 22,"necessary, to push on to Yeddo."
Chapter 22,"The Japanese quarter of Yokohama is called Benten, after the goddess of"
Chapter 22,"the sea, who is worshipped on the islands round about. There"
Chapter 22,"Passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves, sacred gates of a"
Chapter 22,"singular architecture, bridges half hid in the midst of bamboos and"
Chapter 22,"reeds, temples shaded by immense cedar-trees, holy retreats where were"
Chapter 22,"sheltered Buddhist priests and sectaries of Confucius, and interminable"
Chapter 22,"streets, where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked"
Chapter 22,"children, who looked as if they had been cut out of Japanese screens,"
Chapter 22,and who were playing in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish
Chapter 22,"cats, might have been gathered."
Chapter 22,The streets were crowded with people. Priests were passing in
Chapter 22,"processions, beating their dreary tambourines; police and custom-house"
Chapter 22,officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two sabres
Chapter 22,"hung to their waists; soldiers, clad in blue cotton with white stripes,"
Chapter 22,"and bearing guns; the Mikado’s guards, enveloped in silken doubles,"
Chapter 22,hauberks and coats of mail; and numbers of military folk of all
Chapter 22,ranks—for the military profession is as much respected in Japan as it
Chapter 22,is despised in China—went hither and thither in groups and pairs.
Chapter 22,"Passepartout saw, too, begging friars, long-robed pilgrims, and simple"
Chapter 22,"civilians, with their warped and jet-black hair, big heads, long busts,"
Chapter 22,"slender legs, short stature, and complexions varying from copper-colour"
Chapter 22,"to a dead white, but never yellow, like the Chinese, from whom the"
Chapter 22,Japanese widely differ. He did not fail to observe the curious
Chapter 22,"equipages—carriages and palanquins, barrows supplied with sails, and"
Chapter 22,litters made of bamboo; nor the women—whom he thought not especially
Chapter 22,"handsome—who took little steps with their little feet, whereon they"
Chapter 22,"wore canvas shoes, straw sandals, and clogs of worked wood, and who"
Chapter 22,"displayed tight-looking eyes, flat chests, teeth fashionably blackened,"
Chapter 22,"and gowns crossed with silken scarfs, tied in an enormous knot behind"
Chapter 22,an ornament which the modern Parisian ladies seem to have borrowed from
Chapter 22,the dames of Japan.
Chapter 22,Passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley
Chapter 22,"crowd, looking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops, the"
Chapter 22,"jewellery establishments glittering with quaint Japanese ornaments, the"
Chapter 22,"restaurants decked with streamers and banners, the tea-houses, where"
Chapter 22,"the odorous beverage was being drunk with “saki,” a liquor concocted"
Chapter 22,"from the fermentation of rice, and the comfortable smoking-houses,"
Chapter 22,"where they were puffing, not opium, which is almost unknown in Japan,"
Chapter 22,"but a very fine, stringy tobacco. He went on till he found himself in"
Chapter 22,"the fields, in the midst of vast rice plantations. There he saw"
Chapter 22,"dazzling camellias expanding themselves, with flowers which were giving"
Chapter 22,"forth their last colours and perfumes, not on bushes, but on trees, and"
Chapter 22,"within bamboo enclosures, cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the"
Chapter 22,"Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit, and"
Chapter 22,"which queerly-fashioned, grinning scarecrows protected from the"
Chapter 22,"sparrows, pigeons, ravens, and other voracious birds. On the branches"
Chapter 22,of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the
Chapter 22,"weeping willows were herons, solemnly standing on one leg; and on every"
Chapter 22,"hand were crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and a multitude of cranes,"
Chapter 22,"which the Japanese consider sacred, and which to their minds symbolise"
Chapter 22,long life and prosperity.
Chapter 22,"As he was strolling along, Passepartout espied some violets among the"
Chapter 22,shrubs.
Chapter 22,“Good!” said he; “I’ll have some supper.”
Chapter 22,"But, on smelling them, he found that they were odourless."
Chapter 22,"“No chance there,” thought he."
Chapter 22,The worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a
Chapter 22,"breakfast as possible before leaving the “Carnatic;” but, as he had"
Chapter 22,"been walking about all day, the demands of hunger were becoming"
Chapter 22,importunate. He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither
Chapter 22,"mutton, goat, nor pork; and, knowing also that it is a sacrilege to"
Chapter 22,"kill cattle, which are preserved solely for farming, he made up his"
Chapter 22,mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama—nor was he mistaken;
Chapter 22,"and, in default of butcher’s meat, he could have wished for a quarter"
Chapter 22,"of wild boar or deer, a partridge, or some quails, some game or fish,"
Chapter 22,"which, with rice, the Japanese eat almost exclusively. But he found it"
Chapter 22,"necessary to keep up a stout heart, and to postpone the meal he craved"
Chapter 22,"till the following morning. Night came, and Passepartout re-entered the"
Chapter 22,"native quarter, where he wandered through the streets, lit by"
Chapter 22,"vari-coloured lanterns, looking on at the dancers, who were executing"
Chapter 22,"skilful steps and boundings, and the astrologers who stood in the open"
Chapter 22,"air with their telescopes. Then he came to the harbour, which was lit"
Chapter 22,"up by the resin torches of the fishermen, who were fishing from their"
Chapter 22,boats.
Chapter 22,"The streets at last became quiet, and the patrol, the officers of"
Chapter 22,"which, in their splendid costumes, and surrounded by their suites,"
Chapter 22,"Passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors, succeeded the bustling"
Chapter 22,"crowd. Each time a company passed, Passepartout chuckled, and said to"
Chapter 22,himself: “Good! another Japanese embassy departing for Europe!”
Chapter 23,CHAPTER XXIII.
Chapter 23,IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT’S NOSE BECOMES OUTRAGEOUSLY LONG
Chapter 23,"The next morning poor, jaded, famished Passepartout said to himself"
Chapter 23,"that he must get something to eat at all hazards, and the sooner he did"
Chapter 23,"so the better. He might, indeed, sell his watch; but he would have"
Chapter 23,"starved first. Now or never he must use the strong, if not melodious"
Chapter 23,voice which nature had bestowed upon him. He knew several French and
Chapter 23,"English songs, and resolved to try them upon the Japanese, who must be"
Chapter 23,"lovers of music, since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals,"
Chapter 23,"tam-tams, and tambourines, and could not but appreciate European"
Chapter 23,talent.
Chapter 23,"It was, perhaps, rather early in the morning to get up a concert, and"
Chapter 23,"the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers, might not"
Chapter 23,possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the Mikado’s features.
Chapter 23,"Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours; and, as he was"
Chapter 23,"sauntering along, it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well"
Chapter 23,dressed for a wandering artist. The idea struck him to change his
Chapter 23,garments for clothes more in harmony with his project; by which he
Chapter 23,might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of
Chapter 23,"hunger. The resolution taken, it remained to carry it out."
Chapter 23,It was only after a long search that Passepartout discovered a native
Chapter 23,"dealer in old clothes, to whom he applied for an exchange. The man"
Chapter 23,"liked the European costume, and ere long Passepartout issued from his"
Chapter 23,"shop accoutred in an old Japanese coat, and a sort of one-sided turban,"
Chapter 23,"faded with long use. A few small pieces of silver, moreover, jingled in"
Chapter 23,his pocket.
Chapter 23,“Good!” thought he. “I will imagine I am at the Carnival!”
Chapter 23,"His first care, after being thus “Japanesed,” was to enter a tea-house"
Chapter 23,"of modest appearance, and, upon half a bird and a little rice, to"
Chapter 23,breakfast like a man for whom dinner was as yet a problem to be solved.
Chapter 23,"“Now,” thought he, when he had eaten heartily, “I mustn’t lose my head."
Chapter 23,I can’t sell this costume again for one still more Japanese. I must
Chapter 23,"consider how to leave this country of the Sun, of which I shall not"
Chapter 23,"retain the most delightful of memories, as quickly as possible.”"
Chapter 23,It occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about to leave for
Chapter 23,"America. He would offer himself as a cook or servant, in payment of his"
Chapter 23,"passage and meals. Once at San Francisco, he would find some means of"
Chapter 23,"going on. The difficulty was, how to traverse the four thousand seven"
Chapter 23,hundred miles of the Pacific which lay between Japan and the New World.
Chapter 23,"Passepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging, and directed"
Chapter 23,"his steps towards the docks. But, as he approached them, his project,"
Chapter 23,"which at first had seemed so simple, began to grow more and more"
Chapter 23,formidable to his mind. What need would they have of a cook or servant
Chapter 23,"on an American steamer, and what confidence would they put in him,"
Chapter 23,dressed as he was? What references could he give?
Chapter 23,"As he was reflecting in this wise, his eyes fell upon an immense"
Chapter 23,placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets. This
Chapter 23,"placard, which was in English, read as follows:"
Chapter 23,"ACROBATIC JAPANESE TROUPE,"
Chapter 23,"HONOURABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR, PROPRIETOR,"
Chapter 23,"LAST REPRESENTATIONS,"
Chapter 23,"PRIOR TO THEIR DEPARTURE TO THE UNITED STATES,"
Chapter 23,OF THE
Chapter 23,LONG NOSES! LONG NOSES!
Chapter 23,UNDER THE DIRECT PATRONAGE OF THE GOD TINGOU!
Chapter 23,GREAT ATTRACTION!
Chapter 23,“The United States!” said Passepartout; “that’s just what I want!”
Chapter 23,"He followed the clown, and soon found himself once more in the Japanese"
Chapter 23,"quarter. A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin,"
Chapter 23,"adorned with several clusters of streamers, the exterior walls of which"
Chapter 23,"were designed to represent, in violent colours and without perspective,"
Chapter 23,a company of jugglers.
Chapter 23,This was the Honourable William Batulcar’s establishment. That
Chapter 23,"gentleman was a sort of Barnum, the director of a troupe of"
Chapter 23,"mountebanks, jugglers, clowns, acrobats, equilibrists, and gymnasts,"
Chapter 23,"who, according to the placard, was giving his last performances before"
Chapter 23,leaving the Empire of the Sun for the States of the Union.
Chapter 23,"Passepartout entered and asked for Mr. Batulcar, who straightway"
Chapter 23,appeared in person.
Chapter 23,"“What do you want?” said he to Passepartout, whom he at first took for"
Chapter 23,a native.
Chapter 23,"“Would you like a servant, sir?” asked Passepartout."
Chapter 23,"“A servant!” cried Mr. Batulcar, caressing the thick grey beard which"
Chapter 23,"hung from his chin. “I already have two who are obedient and faithful,"
Chapter 23,"have never left me, and serve me for their nourishment and here they"
Chapter 23,"are,” added he, holding out his two robust arms, furrowed with veins as"
Chapter 23,large as the strings of a bass-viol.
Chapter 23,“So I can be of no use to you?”
Chapter 23,“None.”
Chapter 23,“The devil! I should so like to cross the Pacific with you!”
Chapter 23,“Ah!” said the Honourable Mr. Batulcar. “You are no more a Japanese
Chapter 23,than I am a monkey! Who are you dressed up in that way?”
Chapter 23,“A man dresses as he can.”
Chapter 23,"“That’s true. You are a Frenchman, aren’t you?”"
Chapter 23,“Yes; a Parisian of Paris.”
Chapter 23,“Then you ought to know how to make grimaces?”
Chapter 23,"“Why,” replied Passepartout, a little vexed that his nationality should"
Chapter 23,"cause this question, “we Frenchmen know how to make grimaces, it is"
Chapter 23,true but not any better than the Americans do.”
Chapter 23,"“True. Well, if I can’t take you as a servant, I can as a clown. You"
Chapter 23,"see, my friend, in France they exhibit foreign clowns, and in foreign"
Chapter 23,parts French clowns.”
Chapter 23,“Ah!”
Chapter 23,"“You are pretty strong, eh?”"
Chapter 23,“Especially after a good meal.”
Chapter 23,“And you can sing?”
Chapter 23,"“Yes,” returned Passepartout, who had formerly been wont to sing in the"
Chapter 23,streets.
Chapter 23,"“But can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on your"
Chapter 23,"left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?”"
Chapter 23,"“Humph! I think so,” replied Passepartout, recalling the exercises of"
Chapter 23,his younger days.
Chapter 23,"“Well, that’s enough,” said the Honourable William Batulcar."
Chapter 23,The engagement was concluded there and then.
Chapter 23,Passepartout had at last found something to do. He was engaged to act
Chapter 23,in the celebrated Japanese troupe. It was not a very dignified
Chapter 23,"position, but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco."
Chapter 23,"The performance, so noisily announced by the Honourable Mr. Batulcar,"
Chapter 23,"was to commence at three o’clock, and soon the deafening instruments of"
Chapter 23,"a Japanese orchestra resounded at the door. Passepartout, though he had"
Chapter 23,"not been able to study or rehearse a part, was designated to lend the"
Chapter 23,aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the “human
Chapter 23,"pyramid,” executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou. This “great"
Chapter 23,attraction” was to close the performance.
Chapter 23,"Before three o’clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators,"
Chapter 23,"comprising Europeans and natives, Chinese and Japanese, men, women and"
Chapter 23,"children, who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into"
Chapter 23,"the boxes opposite the stage. The musicians took up a position inside,"
Chapter 23,"and were vigorously performing on their gongs, tam-tams, flutes, bones,"
Chapter 23,"tambourines, and immense drums."
Chapter 23,The performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be
Chapter 23,confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world.
Chapter 23,"One, with a fan and some bits of paper, performed the graceful trick of"
Chapter 23,"the butterflies and the flowers; another traced in the air, with the"
Chapter 23,"odorous smoke of his pipe, a series of blue words, which composed a"
Chapter 23,compliment to the audience; while a third juggled with some lighted
Chapter 23,"candles, which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips,"
Chapter 23,and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling.
Chapter 23,Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top;
Chapter 23,in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of
Chapter 23,"their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems, the"
Chapter 23,"edges of sabres, wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they"
Chapter 23,"turned around on the edges of large glasses, crossed bamboo ladders,"
Chapter 23,"dispersed into all the corners, and produced strange musical effects by"
Chapter 23,the combination of their various pitches of tone. The jugglers tossed
Chapter 23,"them in the air, threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores,"
Chapter 23,"and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets, and"
Chapter 23,took them out still whirling as before.
Chapter 23,It is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats
Chapter 23,"and gymnasts. The turning on ladders, poles, balls, barrels, &c., was"
Chapter 23,executed with wonderful precision.
Chapter 23,"But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the Long Noses, a"
Chapter 23,show to which Europe is as yet a stranger.
Chapter 23,"The Long Noses form a peculiar company, under the direct patronage of"
Chapter 23,"the god Tingou. Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages, they bore"
Chapter 23,upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings; but what especially
Chapter 23,distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their
Chapter 23,"faces, and the uses which they made of them. These noses were made of"
Chapter 23,"bamboo, and were five, six, and even ten feet long, some straight,"
Chapter 23,"others curved, some ribboned, and some having imitation warts upon"
Chapter 23,"them. It was upon these appendages, fixed tightly on their real noses,"
Chapter 23,that they performed their gymnastic exercises. A dozen of these
Chapter 23,"sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs, while others, dressed to"
Chapter 23,"represent lightning-rods, came and frolicked on their noses, jumping"
Chapter 23,"from one to another, and performing the most skilful leapings and"
Chapter 23,somersaults.
Chapter 23,"As a last scene, a “human pyramid” had been announced, in which fifty"
Chapter 23,"Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut. But, instead of"
Chapter 23,"forming a pyramid by mounting each other’s shoulders, the artists were"
Chapter 23,to group themselves on top of the noses. It happened that the performer
Chapter 23,"who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the troupe, and"
Chapter 23,"as, to fill this part, only strength and adroitness were necessary,"
Chapter 23,Passepartout had been chosen to take his place.
Chapter 23,The poor fellow really felt sad when—melancholy reminiscence of his
Chapter 23,"youth!—he donned his costume, adorned with vari-coloured wings, and"
Chapter 23,fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long. But he
Chapter 23,cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to
Chapter 23,eat.
Chapter 23,"He went upon the stage, and took his place beside the rest who were to"
Chapter 23,compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut. They all stretched
Chapter 23,"themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the ceiling. A second"
Chapter 23,"group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages, then a"
Chapter 23,"third above these, then a fourth, until a human monument reaching to"
Chapter 23,the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses. This
Chapter 23,"elicited loud applause, in the midst of which the orchestra was just"
Chapter 23,"striking up a deafening air, when the pyramid tottered, the balance was"
Chapter 23,"lost, one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid, and the human"
Chapter 23,monument was shattered like a castle built of cards!
Chapter 23,"It was Passepartout’s fault. Abandoning his position, clearing the"
Chapter 23,"footlights without the aid of his wings, and, clambering up to the"
Chapter 23,"right-hand gallery, he fell at the feet of one of the spectators,"
Chapter 23,"crying, “Ah, my master! my master!”"
Chapter 23,“You here?”
Chapter 23,“Myself.”
Chapter 23,"“Very well; then let us go to the steamer, young man!”"
Chapter 23,"Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout passed through the lobby of the"
Chapter 23,"theatre to the outside, where they encountered the Honourable Mr."
Chapter 23,"Batulcar, furious with rage. He demanded damages for the “breakage” of"
Chapter 23,the pyramid; and Phileas Fogg appeased him by giving him a handful of
Chapter 23,banknotes.
Chapter 23,"At half-past six, the very hour of departure, Mr. Fogg and Aouda,"
Chapter 23,"followed by Passepartout, who in his hurry had retained his wings, and"
Chapter 23,"nose six feet long, stepped upon the American steamer."
Chapter 24,CHAPTER XXIV.
Chapter 24,DURING WHICH MR. FOGG AND PARTY CROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN
Chapter 24,What happened when the pilot-boat came in sight of Shanghai will be
Chapter 24,easily guessed. The signals made by the “Tankadere” had been seen by
Chapter 24,"the captain of the Yokohama steamer, who, espying the flag at"
Chapter 24,"half-mast, had directed his course towards the little craft. Phileas"
Chapter 24,"Fogg, after paying the stipulated price of his passage to John Busby,"
Chapter 24,and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and
Chapter 24,"fifty pounds, ascended the steamer with Aouda and Fix; and they started"
Chapter 24,at once for Nagasaki and Yokohama.
Chapter 24,They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of November.
Chapter 24,"Phileas Fogg lost no time in going on board the “Carnatic,” where he"
Chapter 24,"learned, to Aouda’s great delight—and perhaps to his own, though he"
Chapter 24,"betrayed no emotion—that Passepartout, a Frenchman, had really arrived"
Chapter 24,on her the day before.
Chapter 24,"The San Francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening, and"
Chapter 24,"it became necessary to find Passepartout, if possible, without delay."
Chapter 24,"Mr. Fogg applied in vain to the French and English consuls, and, after"
Chapter 24,"wandering through the streets a long time, began to despair of finding"
Chapter 24,"his missing servant. Chance, or perhaps a kind of presentiment, at last"
Chapter 24,led him into the Honourable Mr. Batulcar’s theatre. He certainly would
Chapter 24,not have recognised Passepartout in the eccentric mountebank’s costume;
Chapter 24,"but the latter, lying on his back, perceived his master in the gallery."
Chapter 24,"He could not help starting, which so changed the position of his nose"
Chapter 24,as to bring the “pyramid” pell-mell upon the stage.
Chapter 24,"All this Passepartout learned from Aouda, who recounted to him what had"
Chapter 24,taken place on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the
Chapter 24,"“Tankadere,” in company with one Mr. Fix."
Chapter 24,Passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name. He
Chapter 24,thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what
Chapter 24,"had taken place between the detective and himself; and, in the account"
Chapter 24,"he gave of his absence, he simply excused himself for having been"
Chapter 24,"overtaken by drunkenness, in smoking opium at a tavern in Hong Kong."
Chapter 24,"Mr. Fogg heard this narrative coldly, without a word; and then"
Chapter 24,furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in
Chapter 24,harmony with his position. Within an hour the Frenchman had cut off his
Chapter 24,"nose and parted with his wings, and retained nothing about him which"
Chapter 24,recalled the sectary of the god Tingou.
Chapter 24,The steamer which was about to depart from Yokohama to San Francisco
Chapter 24,"belonged to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and was named the"
Chapter 24,“General Grant.” She was a large paddle-wheel steamer of two thousand
Chapter 24,five hundred tons; well equipped and very fast. The massive
Chapter 24,walking-beam rose and fell above the deck; at one end a piston-rod
Chapter 24,"worked up and down; and at the other was a connecting-rod which, in"
Chapter 24,"changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one, was directly"
Chapter 24,connected with the shaft of the paddles. The “General Grant” was rigged
Chapter 24,"with three masts, giving a large capacity for sails, and thus"
Chapter 24,"materially aiding the steam power. By making twelve miles an hour, she"
Chapter 24,would cross the ocean in twenty-one days. Phileas Fogg was therefore
Chapter 24,justified in hoping that he would reach San Francisco by the 2nd of
Chapter 24,"December, New York by the 11th, and London on the 20th—thus gaining"
Chapter 24,several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of December.
Chapter 24,"There was a full complement of passengers on board, among them English,"
Chapter 24,"many Americans, a large number of coolies on their way to California,"
Chapter 24,"and several East Indian officers, who were spending their vacation in"
Chapter 24,making the tour of the world. Nothing of moment happened on the voyage;
Chapter 24,"the steamer, sustained on its large paddles, rolled but little, and the"
Chapter 24,“Pacific” almost justified its name. Mr. Fogg was as calm and taciturn
Chapter 24,as ever. His young companion felt herself more and more attached to him
Chapter 24,by other ties than gratitude; his silent but generous nature impressed
Chapter 24,her more than she thought; and it was almost unconsciously that she
Chapter 24,yielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon
Chapter 24,"her protector. Aouda took the keenest interest in his plans, and became"
Chapter 24,impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey.
Chapter 24,"She often chatted with Passepartout, who did not fail to perceive the"
Chapter 24,"state of the lady’s heart; and, being the most faithful of domestics,"
Chapter 24,"he never exhausted his eulogies of Phileas Fogg’s honesty, generosity,"
Chapter 24,and devotion. He took pains to calm Aouda’s doubts of a successful
Chapter 24,"termination of the journey, telling her that the most difficult part of"
Chapter 24,"it had passed, that now they were beyond the fantastic countries of"
Chapter 24,"Japan and China, and were fairly on their way to civilised places"
Chapter 24,"again. A railway train from San Francisco to New York, and a"
Chapter 24,"transatlantic steamer from New York to Liverpool, would doubtless bring"
Chapter 24,them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the
Chapter 24,period agreed upon.
Chapter 24,"On the ninth day after leaving Yokohama, Phileas Fogg had traversed"
Chapter 24,"exactly one half of the terrestrial globe. The “General Grant” passed,"
Chapter 24,"on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and"
Chapter 24,"was at the very antipodes of London. Mr. Fogg had, it is true,"
Chapter 24,exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the
Chapter 24,"tour, and there were only twenty-eight left. But, though he was only"
Chapter 24,"half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over"
Chapter 24,two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long
Chapter 24,"circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to"
Chapter 24,"Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama. Could he have followed"
Chapter 24,"without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the"
Chapter 24,whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles;
Chapter 24,"whereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of locomotion, to"
Chapter 24,"traverse twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on the 23rd of November,"
Chapter 24,accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred. And now the course was a
Chapter 24,"straight one, and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their"
Chapter 24,way!
Chapter 24,"It happened also, on the 23rd of November, that Passepartout made a"
Chapter 24,joyful discovery. It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had
Chapter 24,"insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time, and on"
Chapter 24,regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false
Chapter 24,"and unreliable. Now, on this day, though he had not changed the hands,"
Chapter 24,he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship’s chronometers.
Chapter 24,His triumph was hilarious. He would have liked to know what Fix would
Chapter 24,say if he were aboard!
Chapter 24,"“The rogue told me a lot of stories,” repeated Passepartout, “about the"
Chapter 24,"meridians, the sun, and the moon! Moon, indeed! moonshine more likely!"
Chapter 24,"If one listened to that sort of people, a pretty sort of time one would"
Chapter 24,keep! I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself by my
Chapter 24,watch!”
Chapter 24,"Passepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been"
Chapter 24,"divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have"
Chapter 24,"no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then,"
Chapter 24,"instead of as now indicating nine o’clock in the morning, indicate nine"
Chapter 24,"o’clock in the evening, that is, the twenty-first hour after midnight"
Chapter 24,precisely the difference between London time and that of the one
Chapter 24,hundred and eightieth meridian. But if Fix had been able to explain
Chapter 24,"this purely physical effect, Passepartout would not have admitted, even"
Chapter 24,"if he had comprehended it. Moreover, if the detective had been on board"
Chapter 24,"at that moment, Passepartout would have joined issue with him on a"
Chapter 24,"quite different subject, and in an entirely different manner."
Chapter 24,Where was Fix at that moment?
Chapter 24,He was actually on board the “General Grant.”
Chapter 24,"On reaching Yokohama, the detective, leaving Mr. Fogg, whom he expected"
Chapter 24,"to meet again during the day, had repaired at once to the English"
Chapter 24,"consulate, where he at last found the warrant of arrest. It had"
Chapter 24,"followed him from Bombay, and had come by the “Carnatic,” on which"
Chapter 24,steamer he himself was supposed to be. Fix’s disappointment may be
Chapter 24,imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless. Mr. Fogg
Chapter 24,"had left English ground, and it was now necessary to procure his"
Chapter 24,extradition!
Chapter 24,"“Well,” thought Fix, after a moment of anger, “my warrant is not good"
Chapter 24,"here, but it will be in England. The rogue evidently intends to return"
Chapter 24,"to his own country, thinking he has thrown the police off his track."
Chapter 24,"Good! I will follow him across the Atlantic. As for the money, heaven"
Chapter 24,grant there may be some left! But the fellow has already spent in
Chapter 24,"travelling, rewards, trials, bail, elephants, and all sorts of charges,"
Chapter 24,"more than five thousand pounds. Yet, after all, the Bank is rich!”"
Chapter 24,"His course decided on, he went on board the “General Grant,” and was"
Chapter 24,"there when Mr. Fogg and Aouda arrived. To his utter amazement, he"
Chapter 24,"recognised Passepartout, despite his theatrical disguise. He quickly"
Chapter 24,"concealed himself in his cabin, to avoid an awkward explanation, and"
Chapter 24,hoped—thanks to the number of passengers—to remain unperceived by Mr.
Chapter 24,Fogg’s servant.
Chapter 24,"On that very day, however, he met Passepartout face to face on the"
Chapter 24,"forward deck. The latter, without a word, made a rush for him, grasped"
Chapter 24,"him by the throat, and, much to the amusement of a group of Americans,"
Chapter 24,"who immediately began to bet on him, administered to the detective a"
Chapter 24,"perfect volley of blows, which proved the great superiority of French"
Chapter 24,over English pugilistic skill.
Chapter 24,"When Passepartout had finished, he found himself relieved and"
Chapter 24,"comforted. Fix got up in a somewhat rumpled condition, and, looking at"
Chapter 24,"his adversary, coldly said, “Have you done?”"
Chapter 24,“For this time—yes.”
Chapter 24,“Then let me have a word with you.”
Chapter 24,“But I—”
Chapter 24,“In your master’s interests.”
Chapter 24,"Passepartout seemed to be vanquished by Fix’s coolness, for he quietly"
Chapter 24,"followed him, and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers."
Chapter 24,"“You have given me a thrashing,” said Fix. “Good, I expected it. Now,"
Chapter 24,listen to me. Up to this time I have been Mr. Fogg’s adversary. I am
Chapter 24,now in his game.”
Chapter 24,“Aha!” cried Passepartout; “you are convinced he is an honest man?”
Chapter 24,"“No,” replied Fix coldly, “I think him a rascal. Sh! don’t budge, and"
Chapter 24,"let me speak. As long as Mr. Fogg was on English ground, it was for my"
Chapter 24,interest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived. I did
Chapter 24,everything I could to keep him back. I sent the Bombay priests after
Chapter 24,"him, I got you intoxicated at Hong Kong, I separated you from him, and"
Chapter 24,I made him miss the Yokohama steamer.”
Chapter 24,"Passepartout listened, with closed fists."
Chapter 24,"“Now,” resumed Fix, “Mr. Fogg seems to be going back to England. Well,"
Chapter 24,I will follow him there. But hereafter I will do as much to keep
Chapter 24,obstacles out of his way as I have done up to this time to put them in
Chapter 24,"his path. I’ve changed my game, you see, and simply because it was for"
Chapter 24,my interest to change it. Your interest is the same as mine; for it is
Chapter 24,only in England that you will ascertain whether you are in the service
Chapter 24,of a criminal or an honest man.”
Chapter 24,"Passepartout listened very attentively to Fix, and was convinced that"
Chapter 24,he spoke with entire good faith.
Chapter 24,“Are we friends?” asked the detective.
Chapter 24,"“Friends?—no,” replied Passepartout; “but allies, perhaps. At the least"
Chapter 24,"sign of treason, however, I’ll twist your neck for you.”"
Chapter 24,"“Agreed,” said the detective quietly."
Chapter 24,"Eleven days later, on the 3rd of December, the “General Grant” entered"
Chapter 24,"the bay of the Golden Gate, and reached San Francisco."
Chapter 24,Mr. Fogg had neither gained nor lost a single day.
Chapter 25,CHAPTER XXV.
Chapter 25,IN WHICH A SLIGHT GLIMPSE IS HAD OF SAN FRANCISCO
Chapter 25,"It was seven in the morning when Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout set"
Chapter 25,"foot upon the American continent, if this name can be given to the"
Chapter 25,"floating quay upon which they disembarked. These quays, rising and"
Chapter 25,"falling with the tide, thus facilitate the loading and unloading of"
Chapter 25,"vessels. Alongside them were clippers of all sizes, steamers of all"
Chapter 25,"nationalities, and the steamboats, with several decks rising one above"
Chapter 25,"the other, which ply on the Sacramento and its tributaries. There were"
Chapter 25,"also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to Mexico,"
Chapter 25,"Chili, Peru, Brazil, Europe, Asia, and all the Pacific islands."
Chapter 25,"Passepartout, in his joy on reaching at last the American continent,"
Chapter 25,thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine
Chapter 25,"style; but, tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks, he fell through them."
Chapter 25,Put out of countenance by the manner in which he thus “set foot” upon
Chapter 25,"the New World, he uttered a loud cry, which so frightened the"
Chapter 25,innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these
Chapter 25,"movable quays, that they flew noisily away."
Chapter 25,"Mr. Fogg, on reaching shore, proceeded to find out at what hour the"
Chapter 25,"first train left for New York, and learned that this was at six o’clock"
Chapter 25,"p.m.; he had, therefore, an entire day to spend in the Californian"
Chapter 25,"capital. Taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars, he and Aouda"
Chapter 25,"entered it, while Passepartout mounted the box beside the driver, and"
Chapter 25,they set out for the International Hotel.
Chapter 25,From his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity the
Chapter 25,"wide streets, the low, evenly ranged houses, the Anglo-Saxon Gothic"
Chapter 25,"churches, the great docks, the palatial wooden and brick warehouses,"
Chapter 25,"the numerous conveyances, omnibuses, horse-cars, and upon the"
Chapter 25,"side-walks, not only Americans and Europeans, but Chinese and Indians."
Chapter 25,Passepartout was surprised at all he saw. San Francisco was no longer
Chapter 25,"the legendary city of 1849—a city of banditti, assassins, and"
Chapter 25,"incendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a"
Chapter 25,"paradise of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in"
Chapter 25,one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial
Chapter 25,emporium.
Chapter 25,The lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of the
Chapter 25,"streets and avenues, which cut each other at right-angles, and in the"
Chapter 25,"midst of which appeared pleasant, verdant squares, while beyond"
Chapter 25,"appeared the Chinese quarter, seemingly imported from the Celestial"
Chapter 25,Empire in a toy-box. Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were
Chapter 25,rarely to be seen; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere
Chapter 25,"worn by a multitude of nervously active, gentlemanly-looking men. Some"
Chapter 25,"of the streets—especially Montgomery Street, which is to San Francisco"
Chapter 25,"what Regent Street is to London, the Boulevard des Italiens to Paris,"
Chapter 25,"and Broadway to New York—were lined with splendid and spacious stores,"
Chapter 25,which exposed in their windows the products of the entire world.
Chapter 25,"When Passepartout reached the International Hotel, it did not seem to"
Chapter 25,him as if he had left England at all.
Chapter 25,"The ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar, a sort of"
Chapter 25,"restaurant freely open to all passers-by, who might partake of dried"
Chapter 25,"beef, oyster soup, biscuits, and cheese, without taking out their"
Chapter 25,"purses. Payment was made only for the ale, porter, or sherry which was"
Chapter 25,drunk. This seemed “very American” to Passepartout. The hotel
Chapter 25,"refreshment-rooms were comfortable, and Mr. Fogg and Aouda, installing"
Chapter 25,"themselves at a table, were abundantly served on diminutive plates by"
Chapter 25,negroes of darkest hue.
Chapter 25,"After breakfast, Mr. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda, started for the"
Chapter 25,"English consulate to have his passport _visaed_. As he was going out,"
Chapter 25,"he met Passepartout, who asked him if it would not be well, before"
Chapter 25,"taking the train, to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colt’s"
Chapter 25,revolvers. He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains
Chapter 25,"by the Sioux and Pawnees. Mr. Fogg thought it a useless precaution, but"
Chapter 25,"told him to do as he thought best, and went on to the consulate."
Chapter 25,"He had not proceeded two hundred steps, however, when, “by the greatest"
Chapter 25,"chance in the world,” he met Fix. The detective seemed wholly taken by"
Chapter 25,"surprise. What! Had Mr. Fogg and himself crossed the Pacific together,"
Chapter 25,and not met on the steamer! At least Fix felt honoured to behold once
Chapter 25,"more the gentleman to whom he owed so much, and, as his business"
Chapter 25,"recalled him to Europe, he should be delighted to continue the journey"
Chapter 25,in such pleasant company.
Chapter 25,Mr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective—who
Chapter 25,was determined not to lose sight of him—begged permission to accompany
Chapter 25,them in their walk about San Francisco—a request which Mr. Fogg readily
Chapter 25,granted.
Chapter 25,"They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street, where a great crowd"
Chapter 25,"was collected; the side-walks, street, horsecar rails, the shop-doors,"
Chapter 25,"the windows of the houses, and even the roofs, were full of people. Men"
Chapter 25,"were going about carrying large posters, and flags and streamers were"
Chapter 25,floating in the wind; while loud cries were heard on every hand.
Chapter 25,“Hurrah for Camerfield!”
Chapter 25,“Hurrah for Mandiboy!”
Chapter 25,"It was a political meeting; at least so Fix conjectured, who said to"
Chapter 25,"Mr. Fogg, “Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd. There may"
Chapter 25,be danger in it.”
Chapter 25,"“Yes,” returned Mr. Fogg; “and blows, even if they are political, are"
Chapter 25,still blows.”
Chapter 25,"Fix smiled at this remark; and, in order to be able to see without"
Chapter 25,"being jostled about, the party took up a position on the top of a"
Chapter 25,flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery Street.
Chapter 25,"Opposite them, on the other side of the street, between a coal wharf"
Chapter 25,"and a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been erected in the"
Chapter 25,"open air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed."
Chapter 25,For what purpose was this meeting? What was the occasion of this
Chapter 25,excited assemblage? Phileas Fogg could not imagine. Was it to nominate
Chapter 25,some high official—a governor or member of Congress? It was not
Chapter 25,"improbable, so agitated was the multitude before them."
Chapter 25,Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass. All
Chapter 25,"the hands were raised in the air. Some, tightly closed, seemed to"
Chapter 25,"disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries—an energetic way, no"
Chapter 25,"doubt, of casting a vote. The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags"
Chapter 25,"wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters. The"
Chapter 25,"undulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads"
Chapter 25,floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall. Many of the
Chapter 25,"black hats disappeared, and the greater part of the crowd seemed to"
Chapter 25,have diminished in height.
Chapter 25,"“It is evidently a meeting,” said Fix, “and its object must be an"
Chapter 25,"exciting one. I should not wonder if it were about the ‘Alabama,’"
Chapter 25,despite the fact that that question is settled.”
Chapter 25,"“Perhaps,” replied Mr. Fogg, simply."
Chapter 25,"“At least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the"
Chapter 25,Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy.”
Chapter 25,"Aouda, leaning upon Mr. Fogg’s arm, observed the tumultuous scene with"
Chapter 25,"surprise, while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was."
Chapter 25,"Before the man could reply, a fresh agitation arose; hurrahs and"
Chapter 25,excited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners began to be used
Chapter 25,as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction. Thumps
Chapter 25,were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had
Chapter 25,been blocked up in the crowd. Boots and shoes went whirling through the
Chapter 25,"air, and Mr. Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling"
Chapter 25,"in the din, the rout approached the stairway, and flowed over the lower"
Chapter 25,step. One of the parties had evidently been repulsed; but the mere
Chapter 25,lookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had gained the
Chapter 25,upper hand.
Chapter 25,"“It would be prudent for us to retire,” said Fix, who was anxious that"
Chapter 25,"Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury, at least until they got back to"
Chapter 25,"London. “If there is any question about England in all this, and we"
Chapter 25,"were recognised, I fear it would go hard with us.”"
Chapter 25,“An English subject—” began Mr. Fogg.
Chapter 25,He did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the
Chapter 25,"terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood, and there were"
Chapter 25,"frantic shouts of, “Hurrah for Mandiboy! Hip, hip, hurrah!”"
Chapter 25,"It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies, and"
Chapter 25,"taking the Camerfield forces in flank. Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix found"
Chapter 25,themselves between two fires; it was too late to escape. The torrent of
Chapter 25,"men, armed with loaded canes and sticks, was irresistible. Phileas Fogg"
Chapter 25,and Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their fair
Chapter 25,"companion; the former, as cool as ever, tried to defend himself with"
Chapter 25,the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every Englishman’s
Chapter 25,"arm, but in vain. A big brawny fellow with a red beard, flushed face,"
Chapter 25,"and broad shoulders, who seemed to be the chief of the band, raised his"
Chapter 25,"clenched fist to strike Mr. Fogg, whom he would have given a crushing"
Chapter 25,"blow, had not Fix rushed in and received it in his stead. An enormous"
Chapter 25,"bruise immediately made its appearance under the detective’s silk hat,"
Chapter 25,which was completely smashed in.
Chapter 25,"“Yankee!” exclaimed Mr. Fogg, darting a contemptuous look at the"
Chapter 25,ruffian.
Chapter 25,“Englishman!” returned the other. “We will meet again!”
Chapter 25,“When you please.”
Chapter 25,“What is your name?”
Chapter 25,“Phileas Fogg. And yours?”
Chapter 25,“Colonel Stamp Proctor.”
Chapter 25,"The human tide now swept by, after overturning Fix, who speedily got"
Chapter 25,"upon his feet again, though with tattered clothes. Happily, he was not"
Chapter 25,seriously hurt. His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal
Chapter 25,"parts, and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians, which fit"
Chapter 25,less compactly than they are easy to put on. Aouda had escaped
Chapter 25,"unharmed, and Fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue"
Chapter 25,bruise.
Chapter 25,"“Thanks,” said Mr. Fogg to the detective, as soon as they were out of"
Chapter 25,the crowd.
Chapter 25,"“No thanks are necessary,” replied Fix; “but let us go.”"
Chapter 25,“Where?”
Chapter 25,“To a tailor’s.”
Chapter 25,"Such a visit was, indeed, opportune. The clothing of both Mr. Fogg and"
Chapter 25,"Fix was in rags, as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the"
Chapter 25,"contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy. An hour after, they were once"
Chapter 25,"more suitably attired, and with Aouda returned to the International"
Chapter 25,Hotel.
Chapter 25,"Passepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half a dozen"
Chapter 25,"six-barrelled revolvers. When he perceived Fix, he knit his brows; but"
Chapter 25,"Aouda having, in a few words, told him of their adventure, his"
Chapter 25,countenance resumed its placid expression. Fix evidently was no longer
Chapter 25,"an enemy, but an ally; he was faithfully keeping his word."
Chapter 25,"Dinner over, the coach which was to convey the passengers and their"
Chapter 25,"luggage to the station drew up to the door. As he was getting in, Mr."
Chapter 25,"Fogg said to Fix, “You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again?”"
Chapter 25,“No.”
Chapter 25,"“I will come back to America to find him,” said Phileas Fogg calmly."
Chapter 25,“It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be
Chapter 25,"treated in that way, without retaliating.”"
Chapter 25,"The detective smiled, but did not reply. It was clear that Mr. Fogg was"
Chapter 25,"one of those Englishmen who, while they do not tolerate duelling at"
Chapter 25,"home, fight abroad when their honour is attacked."
Chapter 25,"At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station, and found"
Chapter 25,"the train ready to depart. As he was about to enter it, Mr. Fogg called"
Chapter 25,"a porter, and said to him: “My friend, was there not some trouble"
Chapter 25,to-day in San Francisco?”
Chapter 25,"“It was a political meeting, sir,” replied the porter."
Chapter 25,“But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets.”
Chapter 25,“It was only a meeting assembled for an election.”
Chapter 25,"“The election of a general-in-chief, no doubt?” asked Mr. Fogg."
Chapter 25,"“No, sir; of a justice of the peace.”"
Chapter 25,"Phileas Fogg got into the train, which started off at full speed."
Chapter 26,CHAPTER XXVI.
Chapter 26,IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PARTY TRAVEL BY THE PACIFIC RAILROAD
Chapter 26,“From ocean to ocean”—so say the Americans; and these four words
Chapter 26,compose the general designation of the “great trunk line” which crosses
Chapter 26,"the entire width of the United States. The Pacific Railroad is,"
Chapter 26,"however, really divided into two distinct lines: the Central Pacific,"
Chapter 26,"between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, between Ogden"
Chapter 26,and Omaha. Five main lines connect Omaha with New York.
Chapter 26,New York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal
Chapter 26,"ribbon, which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and"
Chapter 26,eighty-six miles. Between Omaha and the Pacific the railway crosses a
Chapter 26,"territory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts, and a"
Chapter 26,"large tract which the Mormons, after they were driven from Illinois in"
Chapter 26,"1845, began to colonise."
Chapter 26,"The journey from New York to San Francisco consumed, formerly, under"
Chapter 26,"the most favourable conditions, at least six months. It is now"
Chapter 26,accomplished in seven days.
Chapter 26,"It was in 1862 that, in spite of the Southern Members of Congress, who"
Chapter 26,"wished a more southerly route, it was decided to lay the road between"
Chapter 26,the forty-first and forty-second parallels. President Lincoln himself
Chapter 26,"fixed the end of the line at Omaha, in Nebraska. The work was at once"
Chapter 26,"commenced, and pursued with true American energy; nor did the rapidity"
Chapter 26,with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution. The road
Chapter 26,"grew, on the prairies, a mile and a half a day. A locomotive, running"
Chapter 26,"on the rails laid down the evening before, brought the rails to be laid"
Chapter 26,"on the morrow, and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in"
Chapter 26,position.
Chapter 26,"The Pacific Railroad is joined by several branches in Iowa, Kansas,"
Chapter 26,"Colorado, and Oregon. On leaving Omaha, it passes along the left bank"
Chapter 26,"of the Platte River as far as the junction of its northern branch,"
Chapter 26,"follows its southern branch, crosses the Laramie territory and the"
Chapter 26,"Wahsatch Mountains, turns the Great Salt Lake, and reaches Salt Lake"
Chapter 26,"City, the Mormon capital, plunges into the Tuilla Valley, across the"
Chapter 26,"American Desert, Cedar and Humboldt Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and"
Chapter 26,"descends, _viâ_ Sacramento, to the Pacific—its grade, even on the Rocky"
Chapter 26,"Mountains, never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile."
Chapter 26,"Such was the road to be traversed in seven days, which would enable"
Chapter 26,"Phileas Fogg—at least, so he hoped—to take the Atlantic steamer at New"
Chapter 26,York on the 11th for Liverpool.
Chapter 26,"The car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight wheels,"
Chapter 26,and with no compartments in the interior. It was supplied with two rows
Chapter 26,"of seats, perpendicular to the direction of the train on either side of"
Chapter 26,an aisle which conducted to the front and rear platforms. These
Chapter 26,"platforms were found throughout the train, and the passengers were able"
Chapter 26,to pass from one end of the train to the other. It was supplied with
Chapter 26,"saloon cars, balcony cars, restaurants, and smoking-cars; theatre cars"
Chapter 26,"alone were wanting, and they will have these some day."
Chapter 26,"Book and news dealers, sellers of edibles, drinkables, and cigars, who"
Chapter 26,"seemed to have plenty of customers, were continually circulating in the"
Chapter 26,aisles.
Chapter 26,"The train left Oakland station at six o’clock. It was already night,"
Chapter 26,"cold and cheerless, the heavens being overcast with clouds which seemed"
Chapter 26,to threaten snow. The train did not proceed rapidly; counting the
Chapter 26,"stoppages, it did not run more than twenty miles an hour, which was a"
Chapter 26,"sufficient speed, however, to enable it to reach Omaha within its"
Chapter 26,designated time.
Chapter 26,"There was but little conversation in the car, and soon many of the"
Chapter 26,passengers were overcome with sleep. Passepartout found himself beside
Chapter 26,"the detective; but he did not talk to him. After recent events, their"
Chapter 26,relations with each other had grown somewhat cold; there could no
Chapter 26,longer be mutual sympathy or intimacy between them. Fix’s manner had
Chapter 26,"not changed; but Passepartout was very reserved, and ready to strangle"
Chapter 26,his former friend on the slightest provocation.
Chapter 26,"Snow began to fall an hour after they started, a fine snow, however,"
Chapter 26,which happily could not obstruct the train; nothing could be seen from
Chapter 26,"the windows but a vast, white sheet, against which the smoke of the"
Chapter 26,locomotive had a greyish aspect.
Chapter 26,At eight o’clock a steward entered the car and announced that the time
Chapter 26,for going to bed had arrived; and in a few minutes the car was
Chapter 26,"transformed into a dormitory. The backs of the seats were thrown back,"
Chapter 26,"bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an ingenious system,"
Chapter 26,"berths were suddenly improvised, and each traveller had soon at his"
Chapter 26,"disposition a comfortable bed, protected from curious eyes by thick"
Chapter 26,curtains. The sheets were clean and the pillows soft. It only remained
Chapter 26,to go to bed and sleep which everybody did—while the train sped on
Chapter 26,across the State of California.
Chapter 26,The country between San Francisco and Sacramento is not very hilly. The
Chapter 26,"Central Pacific, taking Sacramento for its starting-point, extends"
Chapter 26,eastward to meet the road from Omaha. The line from San Francisco to
Chapter 26,"Sacramento runs in a north-easterly direction, along the American"
Chapter 26,"River, which empties into San Pablo Bay. The one hundred and twenty"
Chapter 26,"miles between these cities were accomplished in six hours, and towards"
Chapter 26,"midnight, while fast asleep, the travellers passed through Sacramento;"
Chapter 26,"so that they saw nothing of that important place, the seat of the State"
Chapter 26,"government, with its fine quays, its broad streets, its noble hotels,"
Chapter 26,"squares, and churches."
Chapter 26,"The train, on leaving Sacramento, and passing the junction, Roclin,"
Chapter 26,"Auburn, and Colfax, entered the range of the Sierra Nevada. ’Cisco was"
Chapter 26,reached at seven in the morning; and an hour later the dormitory was
Chapter 26,"transformed into an ordinary car, and the travellers could observe the"
Chapter 26,picturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they were
Chapter 26,"steaming. The railway track wound in and out among the passes, now"
Chapter 26,"approaching the mountain-sides, now suspended over precipices, avoiding"
Chapter 26,"abrupt angles by bold curves, plunging into narrow defiles, which"
Chapter 26,"seemed to have no outlet. The locomotive, its great funnel emitting a"
Chapter 26,"weird light, with its sharp bell, and its cow-catcher extended like a"
Chapter 26,"spur, mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and"
Chapter 26,"cascades, and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic"
Chapter 26,pines.
Chapter 26,There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route. The railway
Chapter 26,"turned around the sides of the mountains, and did not attempt to"
Chapter 26,violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another.
Chapter 26,The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley about
Chapter 26,"nine o’clock, going always northeasterly; and at midday reached Reno,"
Chapter 26,where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast.
Chapter 26,"From this point the road, running along Humboldt River, passed"
Chapter 26,"northward for several miles by its banks; then it turned eastward, and"
Chapter 26,"kept by the river until it reached the Humboldt Range, nearly at the"
Chapter 26,extreme eastern limit of Nevada.
Chapter 26,"Having breakfasted, Mr. Fogg and his companions resumed their places in"
Chapter 26,"the car, and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as"
Chapter 26,"they passed along the vast prairies, the mountains lining the horizon,"
Chapter 26,"and the creeks, with their frothy, foaming streams. Sometimes a great"
Chapter 26,"herd of buffaloes, massing together in the distance, seemed like a"
Chapter 26,moveable dam. These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often
Chapter 26,form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains; thousands
Chapter 26,"of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together, in"
Chapter 26,compact ranks. The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the
Chapter 26,road is once more clear.
Chapter 26,"This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling."
Chapter 26,About twelve o’clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo
Chapter 26,"encumbered the track. The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to"
Chapter 26,clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too
Chapter 26,"great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now"
Chapter 26,"and then deafening bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them,"
Chapter 26,"for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and"
Chapter 26,change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could
Chapter 26,contain.
Chapter 26,The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but
Chapter 26,"Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained"
Chapter 26,"in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the"
Chapter 26,buffaloes to get out of the way.
Chapter 26,"Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to"
Chapter 26,discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.
Chapter 26,"“What a country!” cried he. “Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in"
Chapter 26,"a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I"
Chapter 26,should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw _this_ mishap in his programme!
Chapter 26,And here’s an engineer who doesn’t dare to run the locomotive into this
Chapter 26,herd of beasts!”
Chapter 26,"The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise. He"
Chapter 26,"would have crushed the first buffaloes, no doubt, with the cow-catcher;"
Chapter 26,"but the locomotive, however powerful, would soon have been checked, the"
Chapter 26,"train would inevitably have been thrown off the track, and would then"
Chapter 26,have been helpless.
Chapter 26,"The best course was to wait patiently, and regain the lost time by"
Chapter 26,greater speed when the obstacle was removed. The procession of
Chapter 26,"buffaloes lasted three full hours, and it was night before the track"
Chapter 26,"was clear. The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails,"
Chapter 26,while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon.
Chapter 26,It was eight o’clock when the train passed through the defiles of the
Chapter 26,"Humboldt Range, and half-past nine when it penetrated Utah, the region"
Chapter 26,"of the Great Salt Lake, the singular colony of the Mormons."
Chapter 27,CHAPTER XXVII.
Chapter 27,"IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT UNDERGOES, AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES AN HOUR, A"
Chapter 27,COURSE OF MORMON HISTORY
Chapter 27,"During the night of the 5th of December, the train ran south-easterly"
Chapter 27,for about fifty miles; then rose an equal distance in a north-easterly
Chapter 27,"direction, towards the Great Salt Lake."
Chapter 27,"Passepartout, about nine o’clock, went out upon the platform to take"
Chapter 27,"the air. The weather was cold, the heavens grey, but it was not"
Chapter 27,"snowing. The sun’s disc, enlarged by the mist, seemed an enormous ring"
Chapter 27,"of gold, and Passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its value"
Chapter 27,"in pounds sterling, when he was diverted from this interesting study by"
Chapter 27,a strange-looking personage who made his appearance on the platform.
Chapter 27,"This personage, who had taken the train at Elko, was tall and dark,"
Chapter 27,"with black moustache, black stockings, a black silk hat, a black"
Chapter 27,"waistcoat, black trousers, a white cravat, and dogskin gloves. He might"
Chapter 27,have been taken for a clergyman. He went from one end of the train to
Chapter 27,"the other, and affixed to the door of each car a notice written in"
Chapter 27,manuscript.
Chapter 27,"Passepartout approached and read one of these notices, which stated"
Chapter 27,"that Elder William Hitch, Mormon missionary, taking advantage of his"
Chapter 27,"presence on train No. 48, would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car"
Chapter 27,"No. 117, from eleven to twelve o’clock; and that he invited all who"
Chapter 27,were desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries of the
Chapter 27,religion of the “Latter Day Saints” to attend.
Chapter 27,"“I’ll go,” said Passepartout to himself. He knew nothing of Mormonism"
Chapter 27,"except the custom of polygamy, which is its foundation."
Chapter 27,"The news quickly spread through the train, which contained about one"
Chapter 27,"hundred passengers, thirty of whom, at most, attracted by the notice,"
Chapter 27,ensconced themselves in car No. 117. Passepartout took one of the front
Chapter 27,seats. Neither Mr. Fogg nor Fix cared to attend.
Chapter 27,"At the appointed hour Elder William Hitch rose, and, in an irritated"
Chapter 27,"voice, as if he had already been contradicted, said, “I tell you that"
Chapter 27,"Joe Smith is a martyr, that his brother Hiram is a martyr, and that the"
Chapter 27,persecutions of the United States Government against the prophets will
Chapter 27,also make a martyr of Brigham Young. Who dares to say the contrary?”
Chapter 27,"No one ventured to gainsay the missionary, whose excited tone"
Chapter 27,contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage. No doubt his anger
Chapter 27,arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actually subjected.
Chapter 27,"The government had just succeeded, with some difficulty, in reducing"
Chapter 27,these independent fanatics to its rule. It had made itself master of
Chapter 27,"Utah, and subjected that territory to the laws of the Union, after"
Chapter 27,imprisoning Brigham Young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy. The
Chapter 27,"disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts, and"
Chapter 27,"resisted, by words at least, the authority of Congress. Elder Hitch, as"
Chapter 27,"is seen, was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains."
Chapter 27,"Then, emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures,"
Chapter 27,"he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times: how that, in"
Chapter 27,"Israel, a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals of"
Chapter 27,"the new religion, and bequeathed them to his son Mormon; how, many"
Chapter 27,"centuries later, a translation of this precious book, which was written"
Chapter 27,"in Egyptian, was made by Joseph Smith, junior, a Vermont farmer, who"
Chapter 27,"revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825; and how, in short, the"
Chapter 27,"celestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest, and gave"
Chapter 27,him the annals of the Lord.
Chapter 27,"Several of the audience, not being much interested in the missionary’s"
Chapter 27,"narrative, here left the car; but Elder Hitch, continuing his lecture,"
Chapter 27,"related how Smith, junior, with his father, two brothers, and a few"
Chapter 27,"disciples, founded the church of the “Latter Day Saints,” which,"
Chapter 27,"adopted not only in America, but in England, Norway and Sweden, and"
Chapter 27,"Germany, counts many artisans, as well as men engaged in the liberal"
Chapter 27,"professions, among its members; how a colony was established in Ohio, a"
Chapter 27,"temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars, and a"
Chapter 27,"town built at Kirkland; how Smith became an enterprising banker, and"
Chapter 27,received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by
Chapter 27,Abraham and several famous Egyptians.
Chapter 27,"The Elder’s story became somewhat wearisome, and his audience grew"
Chapter 27,"gradually less, until it was reduced to twenty passengers. But this did"
Chapter 27,"not disconcert the enthusiast, who proceeded with the story of Joseph"
Chapter 27,"Smith’s bankruptcy in 1837, and how his ruined creditors gave him a"
Chapter 27,"coat of tar and feathers; his reappearance some years afterwards, more"
Chapter 27,"honourable and honoured than ever, at Independence, Missouri, the chief"
Chapter 27,"of a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples, and his pursuit"
Chapter 27,"thence by outraged Gentiles, and retirement into the Far West."
Chapter 27,"Ten hearers only were now left, among them honest Passepartout, who was"
Chapter 27,"listening with all his ears. Thus he learned that, after long"
Chapter 27,"persecutions, Smith reappeared in Illinois, and in 1839 founded a"
Chapter 27,"community at Nauvoo, on the Mississippi, numbering twenty-five thousand"
Chapter 27,"souls, of which he became mayor, chief justice, and general-in-chief;"
Chapter 27,"that he announced himself, in 1843, as a candidate for the Presidency"
Chapter 27,"of the United States; and that finally, being drawn into ambuscade at"
Chapter 27,"Carthage, he was thrown into prison, and assassinated by a band of men"
Chapter 27,disguised in masks.
Chapter 27,"Passepartout was now the only person left in the car, and the Elder,"
Chapter 27,"looking him full in the face, reminded him that, two years after the"
Chapter 27,"assassination of Joseph Smith, the inspired prophet, Brigham Young, his"
Chapter 27,"successor, left Nauvoo for the banks of the Great Salt Lake, where, in"
Chapter 27,"the midst of that fertile region, directly on the route of the"
Chapter 27,"emigrants who crossed Utah on their way to California, the new colony,"
Chapter 27,"thanks to the polygamy practised by the Mormons, had flourished beyond"
Chapter 27,expectations.
Chapter 27,"“And this,” added Elder William Hitch, “this is why the jealousy of"
Chapter 27,Congress has been aroused against us! Why have the soldiers of the
Chapter 27,"Union invaded the soil of Utah? Why has Brigham Young, our chief, been"
Chapter 27,"imprisoned, in contempt of all justice? Shall we yield to force? Never!"
Chapter 27,"Driven from Vermont, driven from Illinois, driven from Ohio, driven"
Chapter 27,"from Missouri, driven from Utah, we shall yet find some independent"
Chapter 27,"territory on which to plant our tents. And you, my brother,” continued"
Chapter 27,"the Elder, fixing his angry eyes upon his single auditor, “will you not"
Chapter 27,"plant yours there, too, under the shadow of our flag?”"
Chapter 27,"“No!” replied Passepartout courageously, in his turn retiring from the"
Chapter 27,"car, and leaving the Elder to preach to vacancy."
Chapter 27,"During the lecture the train had been making good progress, and towards"
Chapter 27,half-past twelve it reached the northwest border of the Great Salt
Chapter 27,Lake. Thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this
Chapter 27,"interior sea, which is also called the Dead Sea, and into which flows"
Chapter 27,"an American Jordan. It is a picturesque expanse, framed in lofty crags"
Chapter 27,"in large strata, encrusted with white salt—a superb sheet of water,"
Chapter 27,"which was formerly of larger extent than now, its shores having"
Chapter 27,"encroached with the lapse of time, and thus at once reduced its breadth"
Chapter 27,and increased its depth.
Chapter 27,"The Salt Lake, seventy miles long and thirty-five wide, is situated"
Chapter 27,three miles eight hundred feet above the sea. Quite different from Lake
Chapter 27,"Asphaltite, whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea, it"
Chapter 27,"contains considerable salt, and one quarter of the weight of its water"
Chapter 27,"is solid matter, its specific weight being 1,170, and, after being"
Chapter 27,"distilled, 1,000. Fishes are, of course, unable to live in it, and"
Chapter 27,"those which descend through the Jordan, the Weber, and other streams"
Chapter 27,soon perish.
Chapter 27,"The country around the lake was well cultivated, for the Mormons are"
Chapter 27,"mostly farmers; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals, fields"
Chapter 27,"of wheat, corn, and other cereals, luxuriant prairies, hedges of wild"
Chapter 27,"rose, clumps of acacias and milk-wort, would have been seen six months"
Chapter 27,later. Now the ground was covered with a thin powdering of snow.
Chapter 27,"The train reached Ogden at two o’clock, where it rested for six hours,"
Chapter 27,"Mr. Fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to Salt Lake City,"
Chapter 27,connected with Ogden by a branch road; and they spent two hours in this
Chapter 27,"strikingly American town, built on the pattern of other cities of the"
Chapter 27,"Union, like a checker-board, “with the sombre sadness of right-angles,”"
Chapter 27,as Victor Hugo expresses it. The founder of the City of the Saints
Chapter 27,could not escape from the taste for symmetry which distinguishes the
Chapter 27,"Anglo-Saxons. In this strange country, where the people are certainly"
Chapter 27,"not up to the level of their institutions, everything is done"
Chapter 27,"“squarely”—cities, houses, and follies."
Chapter 27,"The travellers, then, were promenading, at three o’clock, about the"
Chapter 27,streets of the town built between the banks of the Jordan and the spurs
Chapter 27,"of the Wahsatch Range. They saw few or no churches, but the prophet’s"
Chapter 27,"mansion, the court-house, and the arsenal, blue-brick houses with"
Chapter 27,"verandas and porches, surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias,"
Chapter 27,"palms, and locusts. A clay and pebble wall, built in 1853, surrounded"
Chapter 27,the town; and in the principal street were the market and several
Chapter 27,hotels adorned with pavilions. The place did not seem thickly
Chapter 27,"populated. The streets were almost deserted, except in the vicinity of"
Chapter 27,"the temple, which they only reached after having traversed several"
Chapter 27,"quarters surrounded by palisades. There were many women, which was"
Chapter 27,easily accounted for by the “peculiar institution” of the Mormons; but
Chapter 27,it must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists. They are
Chapter 27,"free to marry or not, as they please; but it is worth noting that it is"
Chapter 27,"mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry, as,"
Chapter 27,"according to the Mormon religion, maiden ladies are not admitted to the"
Chapter 27,possession of its highest joys. These poor creatures seemed to be
Chapter 27,"neither well off nor happy. Some—the more well-to-do, no doubt—wore"
Chapter 27,"short, open, black silk dresses, under a hood or modest shawl; others"
Chapter 27,were habited in Indian fashion.
Chapter 27,"Passepartout could not behold without a certain fright these women,"
Chapter 27,"charged, in groups, with conferring happiness on a single Mormon. His"
Chapter 27,"common sense pitied, above all, the husband. It seemed to him a"
Chapter 27,terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across the
Chapter 27,"vicissitudes of life, and to conduct them, as it were, in a body to the"
Chapter 27,Mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of the
Chapter 27,"glorious Smith, who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightful"
Chapter 27,"place, to all eternity. He felt decidedly repelled from such a"
Chapter 27,"vocation, and he imagined—perhaps he was mistaken—that the fair ones of"
Chapter 27,"Salt Lake City cast rather alarming glances on his person. Happily, his"
Chapter 27,stay there was but brief. At four the party found themselves again at
Chapter 27,"the station, took their places in the train, and the whistle sounded"
Chapter 27,"for starting. Just at the moment, however, that the locomotive wheels"
Chapter 27,"began to move, cries of “Stop! stop!” were heard."
Chapter 27,"Trains, like time and tide, stop for no one. The gentleman who uttered"
Chapter 27,the cries was evidently a belated Mormon. He was breathless with
Chapter 27,"running. Happily for him, the station had neither gates nor barriers."
Chapter 27,"He rushed along the track, jumped on the rear platform of the train,"
Chapter 27,"and fell, exhausted, into one of the seats."
Chapter 27,"Passepartout, who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast,"
Chapter 27,"approached him with lively interest, and learned that he had taken"
Chapter 27,flight after an unpleasant domestic scene.
Chapter 27,"When the Mormon had recovered his breath, Passepartout ventured to ask"
Chapter 27,"him politely how many wives he had; for, from the manner in which he"
Chapter 27,"had decamped, it might be thought that he had twenty at least."
Chapter 27,"“One, sir,” replied the Mormon, raising his arms heavenward —“one, and"
Chapter 27,that was enough!”
Chapter 28,CHAPTER XXVIII.
Chapter 28,IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT DOES NOT SUCCEED IN MAKING ANYBODY LISTEN TO
Chapter 28,REASON
Chapter 28,"The train, on leaving Great Salt Lake at Ogden, passed northward for an"
Chapter 28,"hour as far as Weber River, having completed nearly nine hundred miles"
Chapter 28,from San Francisco. From this point it took an easterly direction
Chapter 28,towards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains. It was in the section included
Chapter 28,between this range and the Rocky Mountains that the American engineers
Chapter 28,"found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road, and that the"
Chapter 28,"government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile,"
Chapter 28,instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains.
Chapter 28,"But the engineers, instead of violating nature, avoided its"
Chapter 28,"difficulties by winding around, instead of penetrating the rocks. One"
Chapter 28,"tunnel only, fourteen thousand feet in length, was pierced in order to"
Chapter 28,arrive at the great basin.
Chapter 28,The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the
Chapter 28,"Great Salt Lake. From this point it described a long curve, descending"
Chapter 28,"towards Bitter Creek Valley, to rise again to the dividing ridge of the"
Chapter 28,waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific. There were many creeks in
Chapter 28,"this mountainous region, and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek,"
Chapter 28,"Green Creek, and others, upon culverts."
Chapter 28,"Passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on, while Fix"
Chapter 28,"longed to get out of this difficult region, and was more anxious than"
Chapter 28,"Phileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents,"
Chapter 28,and set foot on English soil.
Chapter 28,"At ten o’clock at night the train stopped at Fort Bridger station, and"
Chapter 28,"twenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory, following the valley of"
Chapter 28,"Bitter Creek throughout. The next day, 7th December, they stopped for a"
Chapter 28,quarter of an hour at Green River station. Snow had fallen abundantly
Chapter 28,"during the night, but, being mixed with rain, it had half melted, and"
Chapter 28,"did not interrupt their progress. The bad weather, however, annoyed"
Chapter 28,"Passepartout; for the accumulation of snow, by blocking the wheels of"
Chapter 28,"the cars, would certainly have been fatal to Mr. Fogg’s tour."
Chapter 28,“What an idea!” he said to himself. “Why did my master make this
Chapter 28,journey in winter? Couldn’t he have waited for the good season to
Chapter 28,increase his chances?”
Chapter 28,While the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the
Chapter 28,"depression of the temperature, Aouda was experiencing fears from a"
Chapter 28,totally different cause.
Chapter 28,"Several passengers had got off at Green River, and were walking up and"
Chapter 28,down the platforms; and among these Aouda recognised Colonel Stamp
Chapter 28,"Proctor, the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the San"
Chapter 28,"Francisco meeting. Not wishing to be recognised, the young woman drew"
Chapter 28,"back from the window, feeling much alarm at her discovery. She was"
Chapter 28,"attached to the man who, however coldly, gave her daily evidences of"
Chapter 28,"the most absolute devotion. She did not comprehend, perhaps, the depth"
Chapter 28,"of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her, which she"
Chapter 28,"called gratitude, but which, though she was unconscious of it, was"
Chapter 28,really more than that. Her heart sank within her when she recognised
Chapter 28,"the man whom Mr. Fogg desired, sooner or later, to call to account for"
Chapter 28,"his conduct. Chance alone, it was clear, had brought Colonel Proctor on"
Chapter 28,"this train; but there he was, and it was necessary, at all hazards,"
Chapter 28,that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary.
Chapter 28,Aouda seized a moment when Mr. Fogg was asleep to tell Fix and
Chapter 28,Passepartout whom she had seen.
Chapter 28,"“That Proctor on this train!” cried Fix. “Well, reassure yourself,"
Chapter 28,madam; before he settles with Mr. Fogg; he has got to deal with me! It
Chapter 28,seems to me that I was the more insulted of the two.”
Chapter 28,"“And, besides,” added Passepartout, “I’ll take charge of him, colonel"
Chapter 28,as he is.”
Chapter 28,"“Mr. Fix,” resumed Aouda, “Mr. Fogg will allow no one to avenge him. He"
Chapter 28,said that he would come back to America to find this man. Should he
Chapter 28,"perceive Colonel Proctor, we could not prevent a collision which might"
Chapter 28,have terrible results. He must not see him.”
Chapter 28,"“You are right, madam,” replied Fix; “a meeting between them might ruin"
Chapter 28,"all. Whether he were victorious or beaten, Mr. Fogg would be delayed,"
Chapter 28,and—”
Chapter 28,"“And,” added Passepartout, “that would play the game of the gentlemen"
Chapter 28,"of the Reform Club. In four days we shall be in New York. Well, if my"
Chapter 28,"master does not leave this car during those four days, we may hope that"
Chapter 28,chance will not bring him face to face with this confounded American.
Chapter 28,"We must, if possible, prevent his stirring out of it.”"
Chapter 28,"The conversation dropped. Mr. Fogg had just woke up, and was looking"
Chapter 28,"out of the window. Soon after Passepartout, without being heard by his"
Chapter 28,"master or Aouda, whispered to the detective, “Would you really fight"
Chapter 28,for him?”
Chapter 28,"“I would do anything,” replied Fix, in a tone which betrayed determined"
Chapter 28,"will, “to get him back living to Europe!”"
Chapter 28,"Passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame, but"
Chapter 28,his confidence in his master remained unbroken.
Chapter 28,"Was there any means of detaining Mr. Fogg in the car, to avoid a"
Chapter 28,meeting between him and the colonel? It ought not to be a difficult
Chapter 28,"task, since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious."
Chapter 28,"The detective, at least, seemed to have found a way; for, after a few"
Chapter 28,"moments, he said to Mr. Fogg, “These are long and slow hours, sir, that"
Chapter 28,we are passing on the railway.”
Chapter 28,"“Yes,” replied Mr. Fogg; “but they pass.”"
Chapter 28,"“You were in the habit of playing whist,” resumed Fix, “on the"
Chapter 28,steamers.”
Chapter 28,“Yes; but it would be difficult to do so here. I have neither cards nor
Chapter 28,partners.”
Chapter 28,"“Oh, but we can easily buy some cards, for they are sold on all the"
Chapter 28,"American trains. And as for partners, if madam plays—”"
Chapter 28,"“Certainly, sir,” Aouda quickly replied; “I understand whist. It is"
Chapter 28,part of an English education.”
Chapter 28,"“I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game. Well, here are"
Chapter 28,"three of us, and a dummy—”"
Chapter 28,"“As you please, sir,” replied Phileas Fogg, heartily glad to resume his"
Chapter 28,favourite pastime even on the railway.
Chapter 28,"Passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward, and soon returned"
Chapter 28,"with two packs of cards, some pins, counters, and a shelf covered with"
Chapter 28,cloth.
Chapter 28,"The game commenced. Aouda understood whist sufficiently well, and even"
Chapter 28,received some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg. As for the
Chapter 28,"detective, he was simply an adept, and worthy of being matched against"
Chapter 28,his present opponent.
Chapter 28,"“Now,” thought Passepartout, “we’ve got him. He won’t budge.”"
Chapter 28,At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of
Chapter 28,"the waters at Bridger Pass, seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four"
Chapter 28,"feet above the level of the sea, one of the highest points attained by"
Chapter 28,the track in crossing the Rocky Mountains. After going about two
Chapter 28,"hundred miles, the travellers at last found themselves on one of those"
Chapter 28,"vast plains which extend to the Atlantic, and which nature has made so"
Chapter 28,propitious for laying the iron road.
Chapter 28,"On the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams, branches of"
Chapter 28,"the North Platte River, already appeared. The whole northern and"
Chapter 28,eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi-circular curtain which
Chapter 28,"is formed by the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains, the highest"
Chapter 28,"being Laramie Peak. Between this and the railway extended vast plains,"
Chapter 28,plentifully irrigated. On the right rose the lower spurs of the
Chapter 28,mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the Arkansas
Chapter 28,"River, one of the great tributaries of the Missouri."
Chapter 28,At half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of Fort
Chapter 28,"Halleck, which commands that section; and in a few more hours the Rocky"
Chapter 28,"Mountains were crossed. There was reason to hope, then, that no"
Chapter 28,accident would mark the journey through this difficult country. The
Chapter 28,"snow had ceased falling, and the air became crisp and cold. Large"
Chapter 28,"birds, frightened by the locomotive, rose and flew off in the distance."
Chapter 28,No wild beast appeared on the plain. It was a desert in its vast
Chapter 28,nakedness.
Chapter 28,"After a comfortable breakfast, served in the car, Mr. Fogg and his"
Chapter 28,"partners had just resumed whist, when a violent whistling was heard,"
Chapter 28,"and the train stopped. Passepartout put his head out of the door, but"
Chapter 28,saw nothing to cause the delay; no station was in view.
Chapter 28,Aouda and Fix feared that Mr. Fogg might take it into his head to get
Chapter 28,"out; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant,"
Chapter 28,“See what is the matter.”
Chapter 28,Passepartout rushed out of the car. Thirty or forty passengers had
Chapter 28,"already descended, amongst them Colonel Stamp Proctor."
Chapter 28,The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way. The
Chapter 28,"engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man, whom"
Chapter 28,"the station-master at Medicine Bow, the next stopping place, had sent"
Chapter 28,"on before. The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion,"
Chapter 28,"in which Colonel Proctor, with his insolent manner, was conspicuous."
Chapter 28,"Passepartout, joining the group, heard the signal-man say, “No! you"
Chapter 28,"can’t pass. The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky, and would not bear the"
Chapter 28,weight of the train.”
Chapter 28,"This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids, about a mile from"
Chapter 28,"the place where they now were. According to the signal-man, it was in a"
Chapter 28,"ruinous condition, several of the iron wires being broken; and it was"
Chapter 28,impossible to risk the passage. He did not in any way exaggerate the
Chapter 28,"condition of the bridge. It may be taken for granted that, rash as the"
Chapter 28,"Americans usually are, when they are prudent there is good reason for"
Chapter 28,it.
Chapter 28,"Passepartout, not daring to apprise his master of what he heard,"
Chapter 28,"listened with set teeth, immovable as a statue."
Chapter 28,"“Hum!” cried Colonel Proctor; “but we are not going to stay here, I"
Chapter 28,"imagine, and take root in the snow?”"
Chapter 28,"“Colonel,” replied the conductor, “we have telegraphed to Omaha for a"
Chapter 28,"train, but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow in less"
Chapter 28,than six hours.”
Chapter 28,“Six hours!” cried Passepartout.
Chapter 28,"“Certainly,” returned the conductor, “besides, it will take us as long"
Chapter 28,as that to reach Medicine Bow on foot.”
Chapter 28,"“But it is only a mile from here,” said one of the passengers."
Chapter 28,"“Yes, but it’s on the other side of the river.”"
Chapter 28,“And can’t we cross that in a boat?” asked the colonel.
Chapter 28,"“That’s impossible. The creek is swelled by the rains. It is a rapid,"
Chapter 28,and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a
Chapter 28,ford.”
Chapter 28,"The colonel launched a volley of oaths, denouncing the railway company"
Chapter 28,"and the conductor; and Passepartout, who was furious, was not"
Chapter 28,"disinclined to make common cause with him. Here was an obstacle,"
Chapter 28,"indeed, which all his master’s banknotes could not remove."
Chapter 28,"There was a general disappointment among the passengers, who, without"
Chapter 28,"reckoning the delay, saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles"
Chapter 28,"over a plain covered with snow. They grumbled and protested, and would"
Chapter 28,certainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg’s attention if he had not
Chapter 28,been completely absorbed in his game.
Chapter 28,Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had
Chapter 28,"occurred, and, with hanging head, he was turning towards the car, when"
Chapter 28,"the engineer, a true Yankee, named Forster called out, “Gentlemen,"
Chapter 28,"perhaps there is a way, after all, to get over.”"
Chapter 28,“On the bridge?” asked a passenger.
Chapter 28,“On the bridge.”
Chapter 28,“With our train?”
Chapter 28,“With our train.”
Chapter 28,"Passepartout stopped short, and eagerly listened to the engineer."
Chapter 28,"“But the bridge is unsafe,” urged the conductor."
Chapter 28,"“No matter,” replied Forster; “I think that by putting on the very"
Chapter 28,highest speed we might have a chance of getting over.”
Chapter 28,“The devil!” muttered Passepartout.
Chapter 28,But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer’s
Chapter 28,"proposal, and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted, and found the"
Chapter 28,plan a very feasible one. He told stories about engineers leaping their
Chapter 28,"trains over rivers without bridges, by putting on full steam; and many"
Chapter 28,of those present avowed themselves of the engineer’s mind.
Chapter 28,"“We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over,” said one."
Chapter 28,“Eighty! ninety!”
Chapter 28,"Passepartout was astounded, and, though ready to attempt anything to"
Chapter 28,"get over Medicine Creek, thought the experiment proposed a little too"
Chapter 28,"American. “Besides,” thought he, “there’s a still more simple way, and"
Chapter 28,"it does not even occur to any of these people! Sir,” said he aloud to"
Chapter 28,"one of the passengers, “the engineer’s plan seems to me a little"
Chapter 28,"dangerous, but—”"
Chapter 28,"“Eighty chances!” replied the passenger, turning his back on him."
Chapter 28,"“I know it,” said Passepartout, turning to another passenger, “but a"
Chapter 28,simple idea—”
Chapter 28,"“Ideas are no use,” returned the American, shrugging his shoulders, “as"
Chapter 28,the engineer assures us that we can pass.”
Chapter 28,"“Doubtless,” urged Passepartout, “we can pass, but perhaps it would be"
Chapter 28,more prudent—”
Chapter 28,"“What! Prudent!” cried Colonel Proctor, whom this word seemed to excite"
Chapter 28,"prodigiously. “At full speed, don’t you see, at full speed!”"
Chapter 28,"“I know—I see,” repeated Passepartout; “but it would be, if not more"
Chapter 28,"prudent, since that word displeases you, at least more natural—”"
Chapter 28,“Who! What! What’s the matter with this fellow?” cried several.
Chapter 28,The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself.
Chapter 28,“Are you afraid?” asked Colonel Proctor.
Chapter 28,“I afraid? Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be
Chapter 28,as American as they!”
Chapter 28,“All aboard!” cried the conductor.
Chapter 28,"“Yes, all aboard!” repeated Passepartout, and immediately. “But they"
Chapter 28,can’t prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to
Chapter 28,"cross the bridge on foot, and let the train come after!”"
Chapter 28,"But no one heard this sage reflection, nor would anyone have"
Chapter 28,acknowledged its justice. The passengers resumed their places in the
Chapter 28,cars. Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed. The
Chapter 28,whist-players were quite absorbed in their game.
Chapter 28,"The locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer, reversing the steam,"
Chapter 28,"backed the train for nearly a mile—retiring, like a jumper, in order to"
Chapter 28,"take a longer leap. Then, with another whistle, he began to move"
Chapter 28,"forward; the train increased its speed, and soon its rapidity became"
Chapter 28,frightful; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive; the piston
Chapter 28,worked up and down twenty strokes to the second. They perceived that
Chapter 28,"the whole train, rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour,"
Chapter 28,hardly bore upon the rails at all.
Chapter 28,And they passed over! It was like a flash. No one saw the bridge. The
Chapter 28,"train leaped, so to speak, from one bank to the other, and the engineer"
Chapter 28,could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station. But
Chapter 28,"scarcely had the train passed the river, when the bridge, completely"
Chapter 28,"ruined, fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow."
Chapter 29,CHAPTER XXIX.
Chapter 29,IN WHICH CERTAIN INCIDENTS ARE NARRATED WHICH ARE ONLY TO BE MET WITH
Chapter 29,ON AMERICAN RAILROADS
Chapter 29,"The train pursued its course, that evening, without interruption,"
Chapter 29,"passing Fort Saunders, crossing Cheyne Pass, and reaching Evans Pass."
Chapter 29,"The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey, eight"
Chapter 29,thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea. The travellers
Chapter 29,"had now only to descend to the Atlantic by limitless plains, levelled"
Chapter 29,"by nature. A branch of the “grand trunk” led off southward to Denver,"
Chapter 29,the capital of Colorado. The country round about is rich in gold and
Chapter 29,"silver, and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled"
Chapter 29,there.
Chapter 29,Thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from San
Chapter 29,"Francisco, in three days and three nights; four days and nights more"
Chapter 29,would probably bring them to New York. Phileas Fogg was not as yet
Chapter 29,behind-hand.
Chapter 29,During the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left; Lodge Pole Creek
Chapter 29,"ran parallel with the road, marking the boundary between the"
Chapter 29,"territories of Wyoming and Colorado. They entered Nebraska at eleven,"
Chapter 29,"passed near Sedgwick, and touched at Julesburg, on the southern branch"
Chapter 29,of the Platte River.
Chapter 29,It was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd
Chapter 29,"of October, 1867, by the chief engineer, General Dodge. Two powerful"
Chapter 29,"locomotives, carrying nine cars of invited guests, amongst whom was"
Chapter 29,"Thomas C. Durant, vice-president of the road, stopped at this point;"
Chapter 29,"cheers were given, the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian"
Chapter 29,"battle, fireworks were let off, and the first number of the _Railway"
Chapter 29,Pioneer_ was printed by a press brought on the train. Thus was
Chapter 29,"celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad, a mighty instrument"
Chapter 29,"of progress and civilisation, thrown across the desert, and destined to"
Chapter 29,link together cities and towns which do not yet exist. The whistle of
Chapter 29,"the locomotive, more powerful than Amphion’s lyre, was about to bid"
Chapter 29,them rise from American soil.
Chapter 29,"Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning, and three"
Chapter 29,hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching
Chapter 29,Omaha. The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch
Chapter 29,"of the Platte River, on its left bank. At nine the train stopped at the"
Chapter 29,"important town of North Platte, built between the two arms of the"
Chapter 29,"river, which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery, a"
Chapter 29,"large tributary, whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above"
Chapter 29,Omaha.
Chapter 29,The one hundred and first meridian was passed.
Chapter 29,Mr. Fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one—not even the
Chapter 29,dummy—complained of the length of the trip. Fix had begun by winning
Chapter 29,"several guineas, which he seemed likely to lose; but he showed himself"
Chapter 29,"a not less eager whist-player than Mr. Fogg. During the morning, chance"
Chapter 29,distinctly favoured that gentleman. Trumps and honours were showered
Chapter 29,upon his hands.
Chapter 29,"Once, having resolved on a bold stroke, he was on the point of playing"
Chapter 29,"a spade, when a voice behind him said, “I should play a diamond.”"
Chapter 29,"Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix raised their heads, and beheld Colonel"
Chapter 29,Proctor.
Chapter 29,Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once.
Chapter 29,"“Ah! it’s you, is it, Englishman?” cried the colonel; “it’s you who are"
Chapter 29,going to play a spade!”
Chapter 29,"“And who plays it,” replied Phileas Fogg coolly, throwing down the ten"
Chapter 29,of spades.
Chapter 29,"“Well, it pleases me to have it diamonds,” replied Colonel Proctor, in"
Chapter 29,an insolent tone.
Chapter 29,"He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been played,"
Chapter 29,"adding, “You don’t understand anything about whist.”"
Chapter 29,"“Perhaps I do, as well as another,” said Phileas Fogg, rising."
Chapter 29,"“You have only to try, son of John Bull,” replied the colonel."
Chapter 29,"Aouda turned pale, and her blood ran cold. She seized Mr. Fogg’s arm"
Chapter 29,and gently pulled him back. Passepartout was ready to pounce upon the
Chapter 29,"American, who was staring insolently at his opponent. But Fix got up,"
Chapter 29,"and, going to Colonel Proctor said, “You forget that it is I with whom"
Chapter 29,"you have to deal, sir; for it was I whom you not only insulted, but"
Chapter 29,struck!”
Chapter 29,"“Mr. Fix,” said Mr. Fogg, “pardon me, but this affair is mine, and mine"
Chapter 29,"only. The colonel has again insulted me, by insisting that I should not"
Chapter 29,"play a spade, and he shall give me satisfaction for it.”"
Chapter 29,"“When and where you will,” replied the American, “and with whatever"
Chapter 29,weapon you choose.”
Chapter 29,Aouda in vain attempted to retain Mr. Fogg; as vainly did the detective
Chapter 29,endeavour to make the quarrel his. Passepartout wished to throw the
Chapter 29,"colonel out of the window, but a sign from his master checked him."
Chapter 29,"Phileas Fogg left the car, and the American followed him upon the"
Chapter 29,"platform. “Sir,” said Mr. Fogg to his adversary, “I am in a great hurry"
Chapter 29,"to get back to Europe, and any delay whatever will be greatly to my"
Chapter 29,disadvantage.”
Chapter 29,"“Well, what’s that to me?” replied Colonel Proctor."
Chapter 29,"“Sir,” said Mr. Fogg, very politely, “after our meeting at San"
Chapter 29,"Francisco, I determined to return to America and find you as soon as I"
Chapter 29,had completed the business which called me to England.”
Chapter 29,“Really!”
Chapter 29,“Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?”
Chapter 29,“Why not ten years hence?”
Chapter 29,"“I say six months,” returned Phileas Fogg; “and I shall be at the place"
Chapter 29,of meeting promptly.”
Chapter 29,"“All this is an evasion,” cried Stamp Proctor. “Now or never!”"
Chapter 29,“Very good. You are going to New York?”
Chapter 29,“No.”
Chapter 29,“To Chicago?”
Chapter 29,“No.”
Chapter 29,“To Omaha?”
Chapter 29,“What difference is it to you? Do you know Plum Creek?”
Chapter 29,"“No,” replied Mr. Fogg."
Chapter 29,"“It’s the next station. The train will be there in an hour, and will"
Chapter 29,stop there ten minutes. In ten minutes several revolver-shots could be
Chapter 29,exchanged.”
Chapter 29,"“Very well,” said Mr. Fogg. “I will stop at Plum Creek.”"
Chapter 29,"“And I guess you’ll stay there too,” added the American insolently."
Chapter 29,"“Who knows?” replied Mr. Fogg, returning to the car as coolly as usual."
Chapter 29,"He began to reassure Aouda, telling her that blusterers were never to"
Chapter 29,"be feared, and begged Fix to be his second at the approaching duel, a"
Chapter 29,request which the detective could not refuse. Mr. Fogg resumed the
Chapter 29,interrupted game with perfect calmness.
Chapter 29,At eleven o’clock the locomotive’s whistle announced that they were
Chapter 29,"approaching Plum Creek station. Mr. Fogg rose, and, followed by Fix,"
Chapter 29,"went out upon the platform. Passepartout accompanied him, carrying a"
Chapter 29,"pair of revolvers. Aouda remained in the car, as pale as death."
Chapter 29,"The door of the next car opened, and Colonel Proctor appeared on the"
Chapter 29,"platform, attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his second. But just"
Chapter 29,"as the combatants were about to step from the train, the conductor"
Chapter 29,"hurried up, and shouted, “You can’t get off, gentlemen!”"
Chapter 29,“Why not?” asked the colonel.
Chapter 29,"“We are twenty minutes late, and we shall not stop.”"
Chapter 29,“But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman.”
Chapter 29,"“I am sorry,” said the conductor; “but we shall be off at once. There’s"
Chapter 29,the bell ringing now.”
Chapter 29,The train started.
Chapter 29,"“I’m really very sorry, gentlemen,” said the conductor. “Under any"
Chapter 29,"other circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you. But, after"
Chapter 29,"all, as you have not had time to fight here, why not fight as we go"
Chapter 29,along?”
Chapter 29,"“That wouldn’t be convenient, perhaps, for this gentleman,” said the"
Chapter 29,"colonel, in a jeering tone."
Chapter 29,"“It would be perfectly so,” replied Phileas Fogg."
Chapter 29,"“Well, we are really in America,” thought Passepartout, “and the"
Chapter 29,conductor is a gentleman of the first order!”
Chapter 29,"So muttering, he followed his master."
Chapter 29,"The two combatants, their seconds, and the conductor passed through the"
Chapter 29,cars to the rear of the train. The last car was only occupied by a
Chapter 29,"dozen passengers, whom the conductor politely asked if they would not"
Chapter 29,"be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments, as two gentlemen"
Chapter 29,had an affair of honour to settle. The passengers granted the request
Chapter 29,"with alacrity, and straightway disappeared on the platform."
Chapter 29,"The car, which was some fifty feet long, was very convenient for their"
Chapter 29,"purpose. The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle, and"
Chapter 29,fire at their ease. Never was duel more easily arranged. Mr. Fogg and
Chapter 29,"Colonel Proctor, each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers,"
Chapter 29,"entered the car. The seconds, remaining outside, shut them in. They"
Chapter 29,were to begin firing at the first whistle of the locomotive. After an
Chapter 29,"interval of two minutes, what remained of the two gentlemen would be"
Chapter 29,taken from the car.
Chapter 29,"Nothing could be more simple. Indeed, it was all so simple that Fix and"
Chapter 29,Passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack. They
Chapter 29,"were listening for the whistle agreed upon, when suddenly savage cries"
Chapter 29,"resounded in the air, accompanied by reports which certainly did not"
Chapter 29,issue from the car where the duellists were. The reports continued in
Chapter 29,front and the whole length of the train. Cries of terror proceeded from
Chapter 29,the interior of the cars.
Chapter 29,"Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg, revolvers in hand, hastily quitted their"
Chapter 29,"prison, and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous. They"
Chapter 29,then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of Sioux.
Chapter 29,"This was not the first attempt of these daring Indians, for more than"
Chapter 29,"once they had waylaid trains on the road. A hundred of them had,"
Chapter 29,"according to their habit, jumped upon the steps without stopping the"
Chapter 29,"train, with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop."
Chapter 29,"The Sioux were armed with guns, from which came the reports, to which"
Chapter 29,"the passengers, who were almost all armed, responded by revolver-shots."
Chapter 29,"The Indians had first mounted the engine, and half stunned the engineer"
Chapter 29,"and stoker with blows from their muskets. A Sioux chief, wishing to"
Chapter 29,"stop the train, but not knowing how to work the regulator, had opened"
Chapter 29,"wide instead of closing the steam-valve, and the locomotive was"
Chapter 29,plunging forward with terrific velocity.
Chapter 29,"The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like enraged"
Chapter 29,"monkeys over the roofs, thrusting open the doors, and fighting hand to"
Chapter 29,"hand with the passengers. Penetrating the baggage-car, they pillaged"
Chapter 29,"it, throwing the trunks out of the train. The cries and shots were"
Chapter 29,constant. The travellers defended themselves bravely; some of the cars
Chapter 29,"were barricaded, and sustained a siege, like moving forts, carried"
Chapter 29,along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour.
Chapter 29,Aouda behaved courageously from the first. She defended herself like a
Chapter 29,"true heroine with a revolver, which she shot through the broken windows"
Chapter 29,whenever a savage made his appearance. Twenty Sioux had fallen mortally
Chapter 29,"wounded to the ground, and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the"
Chapter 29,"rails as if they had been worms. Several passengers, shot or stunned,"
Chapter 29,lay on the seats.
Chapter 29,"It was necessary to put an end to the struggle, which had lasted for"
Chapter 29,"ten minutes, and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if the"
Chapter 29,"train was not stopped. Fort Kearney station, where there was a"
Chapter 29,"garrison, was only two miles distant; but, that once passed, the Sioux"
Chapter 29,would be masters of the train between Fort Kearney and the station
Chapter 29,beyond.
Chapter 29,"The conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg, when he was shot and fell."
Chapter 29,"At the same moment he cried, “Unless the train is stopped in five"
Chapter 29,"minutes, we are lost!”"
Chapter 29,"“It shall be stopped,” said Phileas Fogg, preparing to rush from the"
Chapter 29,car.
Chapter 29,"“Stay, monsieur,” cried Passepartout; “I will go.”"
Chapter 29,"Mr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow, who, opening a door"
Chapter 29,"unperceived by the Indians, succeeded in slipping under the car; and"
Chapter 29,while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other
Chapter 29,"over his head, he made use of his old acrobatic experience, and with"
Chapter 29,"amazing agility worked his way under the cars, holding on to the"
Chapter 29,"chains, aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes, creeping"
Chapter 29,"from one car to another with marvellous skill, and thus gaining the"
Chapter 29,forward end of the train.
Chapter 29,"There, suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender,"
Chapter 29,"with the other he loosened the safety chains; but, owing to the"
Chapter 29,"traction, he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar,"
Chapter 29,"had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out. The train, now"
Chapter 29,"detached from the engine, remained a little behind, whilst the"
Chapter 29,locomotive rushed forward with increased speed.
Chapter 29,"Carried on by the force already acquired, the train still moved for"
Chapter 29,"several minutes; but the brakes were worked and at last they stopped,"
Chapter 29,less than a hundred feet from Kearney station.
Chapter 29,"The soldiers of the fort, attracted by the shots, hurried up; the Sioux"
Chapter 29,"had not expected them, and decamped in a body before the train entirely"
Chapter 29,stopped.
Chapter 29,But when the passengers counted each other on the station platform
Chapter 29,"several were found missing; among others the courageous Frenchman,"
Chapter 29,whose devotion had just saved them.
Chapter 30,CHAPTER XXX.
Chapter 30,IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SIMPLY DOES HIS DUTY
Chapter 30,Three passengers including Passepartout had disappeared. Had they been
Chapter 30,killed in the struggle? Were they taken prisoners by the Sioux? It was
Chapter 30,impossible to tell.
Chapter 30,"There were many wounded, but none mortally. Colonel Proctor was one of"
Chapter 30,"the most seriously hurt; he had fought bravely, and a ball had entered"
Chapter 30,his groin. He was carried into the station with the other wounded
Chapter 30,"passengers, to receive such attention as could be of avail."
Chapter 30,"Aouda was safe; and Phileas Fogg, who had been in the thickest of the"
Chapter 30,"fight, had not received a scratch. Fix was slightly wounded in the arm."
Chapter 30,"But Passepartout was not to be found, and tears coursed down Aouda’s"
Chapter 30,cheeks.
Chapter 30,"All the passengers had got out of the train, the wheels of which were"
Chapter 30,stained with blood. From the tyres and spokes hung ragged pieces of
Chapter 30,"flesh. As far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind, red"
Chapter 30,"trails were visible. The last Sioux were disappearing in the south,"
Chapter 30,along the banks of Republican River.
Chapter 30,"Mr. Fogg, with folded arms, remained motionless. He had a serious"
Chapter 30,"decision to make. Aouda, standing near him, looked at him without"
Chapter 30,"speaking, and he understood her look. If his servant was a prisoner,"
Chapter 30,ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the Indians? “I will
Chapter 30,"find him, living or dead,” said he quietly to Aouda."
Chapter 30,"“Ah, Mr.—Mr. Fogg!” cried she, clasping his hands and covering them"
Chapter 30,with tears.
Chapter 30,"“Living,” added Mr. Fogg, “if we do not lose a moment.”"
Chapter 30,"Phileas Fogg, by this resolution, inevitably sacrificed himself; he"
Chapter 30,pronounced his own doom. The delay of a single day would make him lose
Chapter 30,"the steamer at New York, and his bet would be certainly lost. But as he"
Chapter 30,"thought, “It is my duty,” he did not hesitate."
Chapter 30,The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there. A hundred of his
Chapter 30,"soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station,"
Chapter 30,should the Sioux attack it.
Chapter 30,"“Sir,” said Mr. Fogg to the captain, “three passengers have"
Chapter 30,disappeared.”
Chapter 30,“Dead?” asked the captain.
Chapter 30,“Dead or prisoners; that is the uncertainty which must be solved. Do
Chapter 30,you propose to pursue the Sioux?”
Chapter 30,"“That’s a serious thing to do, sir,” returned the captain. “These"
Chapter 30,"Indians may retreat beyond the Arkansas, and I cannot leave the fort"
Chapter 30,unprotected.”
Chapter 30,"“The lives of three men are in question, sir,” said Phileas Fogg."
Chapter 30,“Doubtless; but can I risk the lives of fifty men to save three?”
Chapter 30,"“I don’t know whether you can, sir; but you ought to do so.”"
Chapter 30,"“Nobody here,” returned the other, “has a right to teach me my duty.”"
Chapter 30,"“Very well,” said Mr. Fogg, coldly. “I will go alone.”"
Chapter 30,"“You, sir!” cried Fix, coming up; “you go alone in pursuit of the"
Chapter 30,Indians?”
Chapter 30,“Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish—him to whom every
Chapter 30,one present owes his life? I shall go.”
Chapter 30,"“No, sir, you shall not go alone,” cried the captain, touched in spite"
Chapter 30,"of himself. “No! you are a brave man. Thirty volunteers!” he added,"
Chapter 30,turning to the soldiers.
Chapter 30,The whole company started forward at once. The captain had only to pick
Chapter 30,"his men. Thirty were chosen, and an old sergeant placed at their head."
Chapter 30,"“Thanks, captain,” said Mr. Fogg."
Chapter 30,“Will you let me go with you?” asked Fix.
Chapter 30,"“Do as you please, sir. But if you wish to do me a favour, you will"
Chapter 30,remain with Aouda. In case anything should happen to me—”
Chapter 30,A sudden pallor overspread the detective’s face. Separate himself from
Chapter 30,the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step! Leave him to
Chapter 30,"wander about in this desert! Fix gazed attentively at Mr. Fogg, and,"
Chapter 30,despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going on within
Chapter 30,"him, he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look."
Chapter 30,"“I will stay,” said he."
Chapter 30,"A few moments after, Mr. Fogg pressed the young woman’s hand, and,"
Chapter 30,"having confided to her his precious carpet-bag, went off with the"
Chapter 30,"sergeant and his little squad. But, before going, he had said to the"
Chapter 30,"soldiers, “My friends, I will divide five thousand dollars among you,"
Chapter 30,if we save the prisoners.”
Chapter 30,It was then a little past noon.
Chapter 30,"Aouda retired to a waiting-room, and there she waited alone, thinking"
Chapter 30,"of the simple and noble generosity, the tranquil courage of Phileas"
Chapter 30,"Fogg. He had sacrificed his fortune, and was now risking his life, all"
Chapter 30,"without hesitation, from duty, in silence."
Chapter 30,"Fix did not have the same thoughts, and could scarcely conceal his"
Chapter 30,"agitation. He walked feverishly up and down the platform, but soon"
Chapter 30,resumed his outward composure. He now saw the folly of which he had
Chapter 30,"been guilty in letting Fogg go alone. What! This man, whom he had just"
Chapter 30,"followed around the world, was permitted now to separate himself from"
Chapter 30,"him! He began to accuse and abuse himself, and, as if he were director"
Chapter 30,"of police, administered to himself a sound lecture for his greenness."
Chapter 30,"“I have been an idiot!” he thought, “and this man will see it. He has"
Chapter 30,"gone, and won’t come back! But how is it that I, Fix, who have in my"
Chapter 30,"pocket a warrant for his arrest, have been so fascinated by him?"
Chapter 30,"Decidedly, I am nothing but an ass!”"
Chapter 30,"So reasoned the detective, while the hours crept by all too slowly. He"
Chapter 30,did not know what to do. Sometimes he was tempted to tell Aouda all;
Chapter 30,but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his
Chapter 30,confidences. What course should he take? He thought of pursuing Fogg
Chapter 30,across the vast white plains; it did not seem impossible that he might
Chapter 30,"overtake him. Footsteps were easily printed on the snow! But soon,"
Chapter 30,"under a new sheet, every imprint would be effaced."
Chapter 30,Fix became discouraged. He felt a sort of insurmountable longing to
Chapter 30,"abandon the game altogether. He could now leave Fort Kearney station,"
Chapter 30,and pursue his journey homeward in peace.
Chapter 30,"Towards two o’clock in the afternoon, while it was snowing hard, long"
Chapter 30,"whistles were heard approaching from the east. A great shadow, preceded"
Chapter 30,"by a wild light, slowly advanced, appearing still larger through the"
Chapter 30,"mist, which gave it a fantastic aspect. No train was expected from the"
Chapter 30,"east, neither had there been time for the succour asked for by"
Chapter 30,telegraph to arrive; the train from Omaha to San Francisco was not due
Chapter 30,till the next day. The mystery was soon explained.
Chapter 30,"The locomotive, which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles,"
Chapter 30,"was that which, having been detached from the train, had continued its"
Chapter 30,"route with such terrific rapidity, carrying off the unconscious"
Chapter 30,"engineer and stoker. It had run several miles, when, the fire becoming"
Chapter 30,"low for want of fuel, the steam had slackened; and it had finally"
Chapter 30,"stopped an hour after, some twenty miles beyond Fort Kearney. Neither"
Chapter 30,"the engineer nor the stoker was dead, and, after remaining for some"
Chapter 30,"time in their swoon, had come to themselves. The train had then"
Chapter 30,"stopped. The engineer, when he found himself in the desert, and the"
Chapter 30,"locomotive without cars, understood what had happened. He could not"
Chapter 30,imagine how the locomotive had become separated from the train; but he
Chapter 30,did not doubt that the train left behind was in distress.
Chapter 30,He did not hesitate what to do. It would be prudent to continue on to
Chapter 30,"Omaha, for it would be dangerous to return to the train, which the"
Chapter 30,"Indians might still be engaged in pillaging. Nevertheless, he began to"
Chapter 30,"rebuild the fire in the furnace; the pressure again mounted, and the"
Chapter 30,"locomotive returned, running backwards to Fort Kearney. This it was"
Chapter 30,which was whistling in the mist.
Chapter 30,The travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place at the
Chapter 30,head of the train. They could now continue the journey so terribly
Chapter 30,interrupted.
Chapter 30,"Aouda, on seeing the locomotive come up, hurried out of the station,"
Chapter 30,"and asked the conductor, “Are you going to start?”"
Chapter 30,"“At once, madam.”"
Chapter 30,"“But the prisoners, our unfortunate fellow-travellers—”"
Chapter 30,"“I cannot interrupt the trip,” replied the conductor. “We are already"
Chapter 30,three hours behind time.”
Chapter 30,“And when will another train pass here from San Francisco?”
Chapter 30,"“To-morrow evening, madam.”"
Chapter 30,“To-morrow evening! But then it will be too late! We must wait—”
Chapter 30,"“It is impossible,” responded the conductor. “If you wish to go, please"
Chapter 30,get in.”
Chapter 30,"“I will not go,” said Aouda."
Chapter 30,"Fix had heard this conversation. A little while before, when there was"
Chapter 30,"no prospect of proceeding on the journey, he had made up his mind to"
Chapter 30,"leave Fort Kearney; but now that the train was there, ready to start,"
Chapter 30,"and he had only to take his seat in the car, an irresistible influence"
Chapter 30,"held him back. The station platform burned his feet, and he could not"
Chapter 30,stir. The conflict in his mind again began; anger and failure stifled
Chapter 30,him. He wished to struggle on to the end.
Chapter 30,"Meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded, among them Colonel"
Chapter 30,"Proctor, whose injuries were serious, had taken their places in the"
Chapter 30,"train. The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard, and the steam"
Chapter 30,"was escaping from the valves. The engineer whistled, the train started,"
Chapter 30,"and soon disappeared, mingling its white smoke with the eddies of the"
Chapter 30,densely falling snow.
Chapter 30,The detective had remained behind.
Chapter 30,"Several hours passed. The weather was dismal, and it was very cold. Fix"
Chapter 30,sat motionless on a bench in the station; he might have been thought
Chapter 30,"asleep. Aouda, despite the storm, kept coming out of the waiting-room,"
Chapter 30,"going to the end of the platform, and peering through the tempest of"
Chapter 30,"snow, as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her,"
Chapter 30,"and to hear, if possible, some welcome sound. She heard and saw"
Chapter 30,"nothing. Then she would return, chilled through, to issue out again"
Chapter 30,"after the lapse of a few moments, but always in vain."
Chapter 30,"Evening came, and the little band had not returned. Where could they"
Chapter 30,"be? Had they found the Indians, and were they having a conflict with"
Chapter 30,"them, or were they still wandering amid the mist? The commander of the"
Chapter 30,"fort was anxious, though he tried to conceal his apprehensions. As"
Chapter 30,"night approached, the snow fell less plentifully, but it became"
Chapter 30,intensely cold. Absolute silence rested on the plains. Neither flight
Chapter 30,of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm.
Chapter 30,"Throughout the night Aouda, full of sad forebodings, her heart stifled"
Chapter 30,"with anguish, wandered about on the verge of the plains. Her"
Chapter 30,"imagination carried her far off, and showed her innumerable dangers."
Chapter 30,What she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible to
Chapter 30,describe.
Chapter 30,"Fix remained stationary in the same place, but did not sleep. Once a"
Chapter 30,"man approached and spoke to him, and the detective merely replied by"
Chapter 30,shaking his head.
Chapter 30,"Thus the night passed. At dawn, the half-extinguished disc of the sun"
Chapter 30,rose above a misty horizon; but it was now possible to recognise
Chapter 30,objects two miles off. Phileas Fogg and the squad had gone southward;
Chapter 30,in the south all was still vacancy. It was then seven o’clock.
Chapter 30,"The captain, who was really alarmed, did not know what course to take."
Chapter 30,Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first? Should he
Chapter 30,"sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those already"
Chapter 30,"sacrificed? His hesitation did not last long, however. Calling one of"
Chapter 30,"his lieutenants, he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance, when"
Chapter 30,gunshots were heard. Was it a signal? The soldiers rushed out of the
Chapter 30,"fort, and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in"
Chapter 30,good order.
Chapter 30,"Mr. Fogg was marching at their head, and just behind him were"
Chapter 30,"Passepartout and the other two travellers, rescued from the Sioux."
Chapter 30,They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort Kearney.
Chapter 30,"Shortly before the detachment arrived, Passepartout and his companions"
Chapter 30,"had begun to struggle with their captors, three of whom the Frenchman"
Chapter 30,"had felled with his fists, when his master and the soldiers hastened up"
Chapter 30,to their relief.
Chapter 30,All were welcomed with joyful cries. Phileas Fogg distributed the
Chapter 30,"reward he had promised to the soldiers, while Passepartout, not without"
Chapter 30,"reason, muttered to himself, “It must certainly be confessed that I"
Chapter 30,cost my master dear!”
Chapter 30,"Fix, without saying a word, looked at Mr. Fogg, and it would have been"
Chapter 30,difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him. As for
Chapter 30,"Aouda, she took her protector’s hand and pressed it in her own, too"
Chapter 30,much moved to speak.
Chapter 30,"Meanwhile, Passepartout was looking about for the train; he thought he"
Chapter 30,"should find it there, ready to start for Omaha, and he hoped that the"
Chapter 30,time lost might be regained.
Chapter 30,“The train! the train!” cried he.
Chapter 30,"“Gone,” replied Fix."
Chapter 30,“And when does the next train pass here?” said Phileas Fogg.
Chapter 30,“Not till this evening.”
Chapter 30,“Ah!” returned the impassible gentleman quietly.
Chapter 31,CHAPTER XXXI.
Chapter 31,"IN WHICH FIX, THE DETECTIVE, CONSIDERABLY FURTHERS THE INTERESTS OF"
Chapter 31,PHILEAS FOGG
Chapter 31,"Phileas Fogg found himself twenty hours behind time. Passepartout, the"
Chapter 31,"involuntary cause of this delay, was desperate. He had ruined his"
Chapter 31,master!
Chapter 31,"At this moment the detective approached Mr. Fogg, and, looking him"
Chapter 31,"intently in the face, said:"
Chapter 31,"“Seriously, sir, are you in great haste?”"
Chapter 31,“Quite seriously.”
Chapter 31,"“I have a purpose in asking,” resumed Fix. “Is it absolutely necessary"
Chapter 31,"that you should be in New York on the 11th, before nine o’clock in the"
Chapter 31,"evening, the time that the steamer leaves for Liverpool?”"
Chapter 31,“It is absolutely necessary.”
Chapter 31,"“And, if your journey had not been interrupted by these Indians, you"
Chapter 31,would have reached New York on the morning of the 11th?”
Chapter 31,“Yes; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left.”
Chapter 31,“Good! you are therefore twenty hours behind. Twelve from twenty leaves
Chapter 31,eight. You must regain eight hours. Do you wish to try to do so?”
Chapter 31,“On foot?” asked Mr. Fogg.
Chapter 31,"“No; on a sledge,” replied Fix. “On a sledge with sails. A man has"
Chapter 31,proposed such a method to me.”
Chapter 31,"It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night, and whose offer"
Chapter 31,he had refused.
Chapter 31,"Phileas Fogg did not reply at once; but Fix, having pointed out the"
Chapter 31,"man, who was walking up and down in front of the station, Mr. Fogg went"
Chapter 31,"up to him. An instant after, Mr. Fogg and the American, whose name was"
Chapter 31,"Mudge, entered a hut built just below the fort."
Chapter 31,"There Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle, a kind of frame on two long"
Chapter 31,"beams, a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge, and upon"
Chapter 31,which there was room for five or six persons. A high mast was fixed on
Chapter 31,"the frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, to which was attached a"
Chapter 31,large brigantine sail. This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist
Chapter 31,"a jib-sail. Behind, a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle. It"
Chapter 31,"was, in short, a sledge rigged like a sloop. During the winter, when"
Chapter 31,"the trains are blocked up by the snow, these sledges make extremely"
Chapter 31,rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another.
Chapter 31,"Provided with more sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind them,"
Chapter 31,they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not
Chapter 31,superior to that of the express trains.
Chapter 31,Mr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft. The
Chapter 31,"wind was favourable, being fresh, and blowing from the west. The snow"
Chapter 31,"had hardened, and Mudge was very confident of being able to transport"
Chapter 31,Mr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha. Thence the trains eastward run
Chapter 31,frequently to Chicago and New York. It was not impossible that the lost
Chapter 31,time might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity was not to be
Chapter 31,rejected.
Chapter 31,Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling in the
Chapter 31,"open air, Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at Fort"
Chapter 31,"Kearney, the servant taking upon himself to escort her to Europe by a"
Chapter 31,better route and under more favourable conditions. But Aouda refused to
Chapter 31,"separate from Mr. Fogg, and Passepartout was delighted with her"
Chapter 31,decision; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fix
Chapter 31,was with him.
Chapter 31,It would be difficult to guess the detective’s thoughts. Was this
Chapter 31,"conviction shaken by Phileas Fogg’s return, or did he still regard him"
Chapter 31,"as an exceedingly shrewd rascal, who, his journey round the world"
Chapter 31,"completed, would think himself absolutely safe in England? Perhaps"
Chapter 31,Fix’s opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified; but he was
Chapter 31,"nevertheless resolved to do his duty, and to hasten the return of the"
Chapter 31,whole party to England as much as possible.
Chapter 31,At eight o’clock the sledge was ready to start. The passengers took
Chapter 31,"their places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in their"
Chapter 31,"travelling-cloaks. The two great sails were hoisted, and under the"
Chapter 31,pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a
Chapter 31,velocity of forty miles an hour.
Chapter 31,"The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, is at"
Chapter 31,"most two hundred miles. If the wind held good, the distance might be"
Chapter 31,traversed in five hours; if no accident happened the sledge might reach
Chapter 31,Omaha by one o’clock.
Chapter 31,"What a journey! The travellers, huddled close together, could not speak"
Chapter 31,"for the cold, intensified by the rapidity at which they were going. The"
Chapter 31,sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves. When the breeze
Chapter 31,came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off the ground
Chapter 31,"by its sails. Mudge, who was at the rudder, kept in a straight line,"
Chapter 31,and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the vehicle had a
Chapter 31,"tendency to make. All the sails were up, and the jib was so arranged as"
Chapter 31,"not to screen the brigantine. A top-mast was hoisted, and another jib,"
Chapter 31,"held out to the wind, added its force to the other sails. Although the"
Chapter 31,"speed could not be exactly estimated, the sledge could not be going at"
Chapter 31,less than forty miles an hour.
Chapter 31,"“If nothing breaks,” said Mudge, “we shall get there!”"
Chapter 31,Mr. Fogg had made it for Mudge’s interest to reach Omaha within the
Chapter 31,"time agreed on, by the offer of a handsome reward."
Chapter 31,"The prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight line, was"
Chapter 31,as flat as a sea. It seemed like a vast frozen lake. The railroad which
Chapter 31,ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the north-west
Chapter 31,"by Great Island, Columbus, an important Nebraska town, Schuyler, and"
Chapter 31,"Fremont, to Omaha. It followed throughout the right bank of the Platte"
Chapter 31,"River. The sledge, shortening this route, took a chord of the arc"
Chapter 31,described by the railway. Mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the
Chapter 31,"Platte River, because it was frozen. The road, then, was quite clear of"
Chapter 31,"obstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear—an accident to"
Chapter 31,"the sledge, and a change or calm in the wind."
Chapter 31,"But the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to bend the"
Chapter 31,"mast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly. These"
Chapter 31,"lashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument, resounded as if"
Chapter 31,vibrated by a violin bow. The sledge slid along in the midst of a
Chapter 31,plaintively intense melody.
Chapter 31,"“Those chords give the fifth and the octave,” said Mr. Fogg."
Chapter 31,"These were the only words he uttered during the journey. Aouda, cosily"
Chapter 31,"packed in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as possible from the"
Chapter 31,"attacks of the freezing wind. As for Passepartout, his face was as red"
Chapter 31,"as the sun’s disc when it sets in the mist, and he laboriously inhaled"
Chapter 31,"the biting air. With his natural buoyancy of spirits, he began to hope"
Chapter 31,"again. They would reach New York on the evening, if not on the morning,"
Chapter 31,"of the 11th, and there were still some chances that it would be before"
Chapter 31,the steamer sailed for Liverpool.
Chapter 31,"Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, by the"
Chapter 31,"hand. He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge,"
Chapter 31,"the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but, checked by some"
Chapter 31,"presentiment, he kept his usual reserve. One thing, however,"
Chapter 31,"Passepartout would never forget, and that was the sacrifice which Mr."
Chapter 31,"Fogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue him from the Sioux. Mr."
Chapter 31,Fogg had risked his fortune and his life. No! His servant would never
Chapter 31,forget that!
Chapter 31,"While each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different, the"
Chapter 31,sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow. The creeks it passed
Chapter 31,over were not perceived. Fields and streams disappeared under the
Chapter 31,uniform whiteness. The plain was absolutely deserted. Between the Union
Chapter 31,Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint Joseph it
Chapter 31,"formed a great uninhabited island. Neither village, station, nor fort"
Chapter 31,"appeared. From time to time they sped by some phantom-like tree, whose"
Chapter 31,white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind. Sometimes flocks of
Chapter 31,"wild birds rose, or bands of gaunt, famished, ferocious prairie-wolves"
Chapter 31,"ran howling after the sledge. Passepartout, revolver in hand, held"
Chapter 31,himself ready to fire on those which came too near. Had an accident
Chapter 31,"then happened to the sledge, the travellers, attacked by these beasts,"
Chapter 31,would have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its even
Chapter 31,"course, soon gained on the wolves, and ere long left the howling band"
Chapter 31,at a safe distance behind.
Chapter 31,About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossing
Chapter 31,"the Platte River. He said nothing, but he felt certain that he was now"
Chapter 31,within twenty miles of Omaha. In less than an hour he left the rudder
Chapter 31,"and furled his sails, whilst the sledge, carried forward by the great"
Chapter 31,"impetus the wind had given it, went on half a mile further with its"
Chapter 31,sails unspread.
Chapter 31,"It stopped at last, and Mudge, pointing to a mass of roofs white with"
Chapter 31,"snow, said: “We have got there!”"
Chapter 31,"Arrived! Arrived at the station which is in daily communication, by"
Chapter 31,"numerous trains, with the Atlantic seaboard!"
Chapter 31,"Passepartout and Fix jumped off, stretched their stiffened limbs, and"
Chapter 31,aided Mr. Fogg and the young woman to descend from the sledge. Phileas
Chapter 31,"Fogg generously rewarded Mudge, whose hand Passepartout warmly grasped,"
Chapter 31,and the party directed their steps to the Omaha railway station.
Chapter 31,The Pacific Railroad proper finds its terminus at this important
Chapter 31,Nebraska town. Omaha is connected with Chicago by the Chicago and Rock
Chapter 31,"Island Railroad, which runs directly east, and passes fifty stations."
Chapter 31,A train was ready to start when Mr. Fogg and his party reached the
Chapter 31,"station, and they only had time to get into the cars. They had seen"
Chapter 31,nothing of Omaha; but Passepartout confessed to himself that this was
Chapter 31,"not to be regretted, as they were not travelling to see the sights."
Chapter 31,"The train passed rapidly across the State of Iowa, by Council Bluffs,"
Chapter 31,"Des Moines, and Iowa City. During the night it crossed the Mississippi"
Chapter 31,"at Davenport, and by Rock Island entered Illinois. The next day, which"
Chapter 31,"was the 10th, at four o’clock in the evening, it reached Chicago,"
Chapter 31,"already risen from its ruins, and more proudly seated than ever on the"
Chapter 31,borders of its beautiful Lake Michigan.
Chapter 31,Nine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York; but trains are not
Chapter 31,"wanting at Chicago. Mr. Fogg passed at once from one to the other, and"
Chapter 31,"the locomotive of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railway left"
Chapter 31,"at full speed, as if it fully comprehended that that gentleman had no"
Chapter 31,"time to lose. It traversed Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey"
Chapter 31,"like a flash, rushing through towns with antique names, some of which"
Chapter 31,"had streets and car-tracks, but as yet no houses. At last the Hudson"
Chapter 31,"came into view; and, at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the"
Chapter 31,"11th, the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river,"
Chapter 31,before the very pier of the Cunard line.
Chapter 31,"The “China,” for Liverpool, had started three-quarters of an hour"
Chapter 31,before!
Chapter 32,CHAPTER XXXII.
Chapter 32,IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG ENGAGES IN A DIRECT STRUGGLE WITH BAD FORTUNE
Chapter 32,"The “China,” in leaving, seemed to have carried off Phileas Fogg’s last"
Chapter 32,hope. None of the other steamers were able to serve his projects. The
Chapter 32,"“Pereire,” of the French Transatlantic Company, whose admirable"
Chapter 32,"steamers are equal to any in speed and comfort, did not leave until the"
Chapter 32,"14th; the Hamburg boats did not go directly to Liverpool or London, but"
Chapter 32,to Havre; and the additional trip from Havre to Southampton would
Chapter 32,render Phileas Fogg’s last efforts of no avail. The Inman steamer did
Chapter 32,"not depart till the next day, and could not cross the Atlantic in time"
Chapter 32,to save the wager.
Chapter 32,"Mr. Fogg learned all this in consulting his “Bradshaw,” which gave him"
Chapter 32,the daily movements of the transatlantic steamers.
Chapter 32,Passepartout was crushed; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by
Chapter 32,"three-quarters of an hour. It was his fault, for, instead of helping"
Chapter 32,"his master, he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path! And when"
Chapter 32,"he recalled all the incidents of the tour, when he counted up the sums"
Chapter 32,"expended in pure loss and on his own account, when he thought that the"
Chapter 32,"immense stake, added to the heavy charges of this useless journey,"
Chapter 32,"would completely ruin Mr. Fogg, he overwhelmed himself with bitter"
Chapter 32,"self-accusations. Mr. Fogg, however, did not reproach him; and, on"
Chapter 32,"leaving the Cunard pier, only said: “We will consult about what is best"
Chapter 32,to-morrow. Come.”
Chapter 32,"The party crossed the Hudson in the Jersey City ferryboat, and drove in"
Chapter 32,"a carriage to the St. Nicholas Hotel, on Broadway. Rooms were engaged,"
Chapter 32,"and the night passed, briefly to Phileas Fogg, who slept profoundly,"
Chapter 32,"but very long to Aouda and the others, whose agitation did not permit"
Chapter 32,them to rest.
Chapter 32,The next day was the 12th of December. From seven in the morning of the
Chapter 32,12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there were
Chapter 32,"nine days, thirteen hours, and forty-five minutes. If Phileas Fogg had"
Chapter 32,"left in the “China,” one of the fastest steamers on the Atlantic, he"
Chapter 32,"would have reached Liverpool, and then London, within the period agreed"
Chapter 32,upon.
Chapter 32,"Mr. Fogg left the hotel alone, after giving Passepartout instructions"
Chapter 32,"to await his return, and inform Aouda to be ready at an instant’s"
Chapter 32,"notice. He proceeded to the banks of the Hudson, and looked about among"
Chapter 32,"the vessels moored or anchored in the river, for any that were about to"
Chapter 32,"depart. Several had departure signals, and were preparing to put to sea"
Chapter 32,at morning tide; for in this immense and admirable port there is not
Chapter 32,one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of
Chapter 32,"the globe. But they were mostly sailing vessels, of which, of course,"
Chapter 32,Phileas Fogg could make no use.
Chapter 32,"He seemed about to give up all hope, when he espied, anchored at the"
Chapter 32,"Battery, a cable’s length off at most, a trading vessel, with a screw,"
Chapter 32,"well-shaped, whose funnel, puffing a cloud of smoke, indicated that she"
Chapter 32,was getting ready for departure.
Chapter 32,"Phileas Fogg hailed a boat, got into it, and soon found himself on"
Chapter 32,"board the “Henrietta,” iron-hulled, wood-built above. He ascended to"
Chapter 32,"the deck, and asked for the captain, who forthwith presented himself."
Chapter 32,"He was a man of fifty, a sort of sea-wolf, with big eyes, a complexion"
Chapter 32,"of oxidised copper, red hair and thick neck, and a growling voice."
Chapter 32,“The captain?” asked Mr. Fogg.
Chapter 32,“I am the captain.”
Chapter 32,"“I am Phileas Fogg, of London.”"
Chapter 32,"“And I am Andrew Speedy, of Cardiff.”"
Chapter 32,“You are going to put to sea?”
Chapter 32,“In an hour.”
Chapter 32,“You are bound for—”
Chapter 32,“Bordeaux.”
Chapter 32,“And your cargo?”
Chapter 32,“No freight. Going in ballast.”
Chapter 32,“Have you any passengers?”
Chapter 32,“No passengers. Never have passengers. Too much in the way.”
Chapter 32,“Is your vessel a swift one?”
Chapter 32,"“Between eleven and twelve knots. The “Henrietta,” well known.”"
Chapter 32,“Will you carry me and three other persons to Liverpool?”
Chapter 32,“To Liverpool? Why not to China?”
Chapter 32,“I said Liverpool.”
Chapter 32,“No!”
Chapter 32,“No?”
Chapter 32,"“No. I am setting out for Bordeaux, and shall go to Bordeaux.”"
Chapter 32,“Money is no object?”
Chapter 32,“None.”
Chapter 32,The captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply.
Chapter 32,“But the owners of the ‘Henrietta’—” resumed Phileas Fogg.
Chapter 32,"“The owners are myself,” replied the captain. “The vessel belongs to"
Chapter 32,me.”
Chapter 32,“I will freight it for you.”
Chapter 32,“No.”
Chapter 32,“I will buy it of you.”
Chapter 32,“No.”
Chapter 32,Phileas Fogg did not betray the least disappointment; but the situation
Chapter 32,"was a grave one. It was not at New York as at Hong Kong, nor with the"
Chapter 32,captain of the “Henrietta” as with the captain of the “Tankadere.” Up
Chapter 32,to this time money had smoothed away every obstacle. Now money failed.
Chapter 32,"Still, some means must be found to cross the Atlantic on a boat, unless"
Chapter 32,"by balloon—which would have been venturesome, besides not being capable"
Chapter 32,"of being put in practice. It seemed that Phileas Fogg had an idea, for"
Chapter 32,"he said to the captain, “Well, will you carry me to Bordeaux?”"
Chapter 32,"“No, not if you paid me two hundred dollars.”"
Chapter 32,“I offer you two thousand.”
Chapter 32,“Apiece?”
Chapter 32,“Apiece.”
Chapter 32,“And there are four of you?”
Chapter 32,“Four.”
Chapter 32,Captain Speedy began to scratch his head. There were eight thousand
Chapter 32,"dollars to gain, without changing his route; for which it was well"
Chapter 32,worth conquering the repugnance he had for all kinds of passengers.
Chapter 32,"Besides, passengers at two thousand dollars are no longer passengers,"
Chapter 32,"but valuable merchandise. “I start at nine o’clock,” said Captain"
Chapter 32,"Speedy, simply. “Are you and your party ready?”"
Chapter 32,"“We will be on board at nine o’clock,” replied, no less simply, Mr."
Chapter 32,Fogg.
Chapter 32,"It was half-past eight. To disembark from the “Henrietta,” jump into a"
Chapter 32,"hack, hurry to the St. Nicholas, and return with Aouda, Passepartout,"
Chapter 32,"and even the inseparable Fix was the work of a brief time, and was"
Chapter 32,performed by Mr. Fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him. They
Chapter 32,were on board when the “Henrietta” made ready to weigh anchor.
Chapter 32,"When Passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to cost, he"
Chapter 32,uttered a prolonged “Oh!” which extended throughout his vocal gamut.
Chapter 32,"As for Fix, he said to himself that the Bank of England would certainly"
Chapter 32,not come out of this affair well indemnified. When they reached
Chapter 32,"England, even if Mr. Fogg did not throw some handfuls of bank-bills"
Chapter 32,"into the sea, more than seven thousand pounds would have been spent!"
Chapter 33,CHAPTER XXXIII.
Chapter 33,IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SHOWS HIMSELF EQUAL TO THE OCCASION
Chapter 33,"An hour after, the “Henrietta” passed the lighthouse which marks the"
Chapter 33,"entrance of the Hudson, turned the point of Sandy Hook, and put to sea."
Chapter 33,"During the day she skirted Long Island, passed Fire Island, and"
Chapter 33,directed her course rapidly eastward.
Chapter 33,"At noon the next day, a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the"
Chapter 33,vessel’s position. It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy.
Chapter 33,"Not the least in the world. It was Phileas Fogg, Esquire. As for"
Chapter 33,"Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and was"
Chapter 33,"uttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable and"
Chapter 33,excessive.
Chapter 33,What had happened was very simple. Phileas Fogg wished to go to
Chapter 33,"Liverpool, but the captain would not carry him there. Then Phileas Fogg"
Chapter 33,"had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he had"
Chapter 33,"been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the"
Chapter 33,"sailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on"
Chapter 33,"the best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body. This was"
Chapter 33,why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the
Chapter 33,"captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the “Henrietta”"
Chapter 33,"was directing her course towards Liverpool. It was very clear, to see"
Chapter 33,"Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor."
Chapter 33,"How the adventure ended will be seen anon. Aouda was anxious, though"
Chapter 33,"she said nothing. As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg’s manœuvre"
Chapter 33,simply glorious. The captain had said “between eleven and twelve
Chapter 33,"knots,” and the “Henrietta” confirmed his prediction."
Chapter 33,"If, then—for there were “ifs” still—the sea did not become too"
Chapter 33,"boisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accident"
Chapter 33,"happened to the boat or its machinery, the “Henrietta” might cross the"
Chapter 33,"three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days,"
Chapter 33,"between the 12th and the 21st of December. It is true that, once"
Chapter 33,"arrived, the affair on board the “Henrietta,” added to that of the Bank"
Chapter 33,"of England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he"
Chapter 33,imagined or could desire.
Chapter 33,"During the first days, they went along smoothly enough. The sea was not"
Chapter 33,"very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the north-east, the"
Chapter 33,"sails were hoisted, and the “Henrietta” ploughed across the waves like"
Chapter 33,a real transatlantic steamer.
Chapter 33,"Passepartout was delighted. His master’s last exploit, the consequences"
Chapter 33,"of which he ignored, enchanted him. Never had the crew seen so jolly"
Chapter 33,"and dexterous a fellow. He formed warm friendships with the sailors,"
Chapter 33,and amazed them with his acrobatic feats. He thought they managed the
Chapter 33,"vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like heroes. His"
Chapter 33,"loquacious good-humour infected everyone. He had forgotten the past,"
Chapter 33,"its vexations and delays. He only thought of the end, so nearly"
Chapter 33,"accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience, as if"
Chapter 33,"heated by the furnaces of the “Henrietta.” Often, also, the worthy"
Chapter 33,"fellow revolved around Fix, looking at him with a keen, distrustful"
Chapter 33,"eye; but he did not speak to him, for their old intimacy no longer"
Chapter 33,existed.
Chapter 33,"Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on. The"
Chapter 33,"conquest of the “Henrietta,” the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing the"
Chapter 33,"boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him. He did not know"
Chapter 33,"what to think. For, after all, a man who began by stealing fifty-five"
Chapter 33,thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was not
Chapter 33,unnaturally inclined to conclude that the “Henrietta” under Fogg’s
Chapter 33,"command, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the"
Chapter 33,"world where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himself"
Chapter 33,"in safety. The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and the"
Chapter 33,detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair.
Chapter 33,"As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and"
Chapter 33,"Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as"
Chapter 33,"he was, took the greatest precautions. Mr. Fogg did not seem even to"
Chapter 33,know that there was a captain on board.
Chapter 33,"On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland, a"
Chapter 33,"dangerous locality; during the winter, especially, there are frequent"
Chapter 33,fogs and heavy gales of wind. Ever since the evening before the
Chapter 33,"barometer, suddenly falling, had indicated an approaching change in the"
Chapter 33,"atmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied, the cold"
Chapter 33,"became sharper, and the wind veered to the south-east."
Chapter 33,"This was a misfortune. Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his"
Chapter 33,"course, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the"
Chapter 33,"vessel’s speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long waves"
Chapter 33,"of which broke against the stern. She pitched violently, and this"
Chapter 33,retarded her progress. The breeze little by little swelled into a
Chapter 33,"tempest, and it was to be feared that the “Henrietta” might not be able"
Chapter 33,to maintain herself upright on the waves.
Chapter 33,"Passepartout’s visage darkened with the skies, and for two days the"
Chapter 33,poor fellow experienced constant fright. But Phileas Fogg was a bold
Chapter 33,"mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept"
Chapter 33,"on his course, without even decreasing his steam. The “Henrietta,” when"
Chapter 33,"she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, but"
Chapter 33,"passing safely. Sometimes the screw rose out of the water, beating its"
Chapter 33,"protruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above the"
Chapter 33,waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead.
Chapter 33,"The wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have been"
Chapter 33,"feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on with"
Chapter 33,"a speed of ninety miles an hour. It continued fresh, but, unhappily, it"
Chapter 33,"remained obstinately in the south-east, rendering the sails useless."
Chapter 33,The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg’s
Chapter 33,"departure from London, and the “Henrietta” had not yet been seriously"
Chapter 33,"delayed. Half of the voyage was almost accomplished, and the worst"
Chapter 33,"localities had been passed. In summer, success would have been"
Chapter 33,"well-nigh certain. In winter, they were at the mercy of the bad season."
Chapter 33,"Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret, and"
Chapter 33,"comforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failed them,"
Chapter 33,they might still count on the steam.
Chapter 33,"On this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and began"
Chapter 33,"to speak earnestly with him. Without knowing why it was a presentiment,"
Chapter 33,perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy. He would have given one of
Chapter 33,his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying. He
Chapter 33,"finally managed to catch a few words, and was sure he heard his master"
Chapter 33,"say, “You are certain of what you tell me?”"
Chapter 33,"“Certain, sir,” replied the engineer. “You must remember that, since we"
Chapter 33,"started, we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces, and, though we"
Chapter 33,"had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux, we"
Chapter 33,haven’t enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool.” “I
Chapter 33,"will consider,” replied Mr. Fogg."
Chapter 33,Passepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety. The
Chapter 33,"coal was giving out! “Ah, if my master can get over that,” muttered he,"
Chapter 33,“he’ll be a famous man!” He could not help imparting to Fix what he had
Chapter 33,overheard.
Chapter 33,“Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool?”
Chapter 33,“Of course.”
Chapter 33,"“Ass!” replied the detective, shrugging his shoulders and turning on"
Chapter 33,his heel.
Chapter 33,"Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, the"
Chapter 33,reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he
Chapter 33,reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed
Chapter 33,"and humiliated in his self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed a"
Chapter 33,"false scent around the world, and refrained."
Chapter 33,And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt? It was difficult to
Chapter 33,"imagine. Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that"
Chapter 33,"evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, “Feed all the fires"
Chapter 33,until the coal is exhausted.”
Chapter 33,"A few moments after, the funnel of the “Henrietta” vomited forth"
Chapter 33,torrents of smoke. The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on;
Chapter 33,"but on the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the"
Chapter 33,coal would give out in the course of the day.
Chapter 33,"“Do not let the fires go down,” replied Mr. Fogg. “Keep them up to the"
Chapter 33,last. Let the valves be filled.”
Chapter 33,"Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called"
Chapter 33,"Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy. It was as if"
Chapter 33,the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger. He went to the
Chapter 33,"poop, saying to himself, “He will be like a madman!”"
Chapter 33,"In a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the"
Chapter 33,poop-deck. The bomb was Captain Speedy. It was clear that he was on the
Chapter 33,point of bursting. “Where are we?” were the first words his anger
Chapter 33,"permitted him to utter. Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he could"
Chapter 33,never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath.
Chapter 33,"“Where are we?” he repeated, with purple face."
Chapter 33,"“Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool,” replied Mr. Fogg, with"
Chapter 33,imperturbable calmness.
Chapter 33,“Pirate!” cried Captain Speedy.
Chapter 33,"“I have sent for you, sir—”"
Chapter 33,“Pickaroon!”
Chapter 33,"“—sir,” continued Mr. Fogg, “to ask you to sell me your vessel.”"
Chapter 33,"“No! By all the devils, no!”"
Chapter 33,“But I shall be obliged to burn her.”
Chapter 33,“Burn the ‘Henrietta’!”
Chapter 33,“Yes; at least the upper part of her. The coal has given out.”
Chapter 33,"“Burn my vessel!” cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely pronounce"
Chapter 33,the words. “A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!”
Chapter 33,"“Here are sixty thousand,” replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain a"
Chapter 33,roll of bank-bills. This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy. An
Chapter 33,American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand
Chapter 33,"dollars. The captain forgot in an instant his anger, his imprisonment,"
Chapter 33,and all his grudges against his passenger. The “Henrietta” was twenty
Chapter 33,years old; it was a great bargain. The bomb would not go off after all.
Chapter 33,Mr. Fogg had taken away the match.
Chapter 33,"“And I shall still have the iron hull,” said the captain in a softer"
Chapter 33,tone.
Chapter 33,“The iron hull and the engine. Is it agreed?”
Chapter 33,“Agreed.”
Chapter 33,"And Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consigned"
Chapter 33,them to his pocket.
Chapter 33,"During this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fix"
Chapter 33,seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit. Nearly twenty thousand
Chapter 33,"pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine to the"
Chapter 33,"captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft! It was true,"
Chapter 33,"however, that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank."
Chapter 33,"When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him, “Don’t"
Chapter 33,"let this astonish you, sir. You must know that I shall lose twenty"
Chapter 33,"thousand pounds, unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on"
Chapter 33,"the evening of the 21st of December. I missed the steamer at New York,"
Chapter 33,and as you refused to take me to Liverpool—”
Chapter 33,“And I did well!” cried Andrew Speedy; “for I have gained at least
Chapter 33,"forty thousand dollars by it!” He added, more sedately, “Do you know"
Chapter 33,"one thing, Captain—”"
Chapter 33,“Fogg.”
Chapter 33,"“Captain Fogg, you’ve got something of the Yankee about you.”"
Chapter 33,"And, having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment, he"
Chapter 33,"was going away, when Mr. Fogg said, “The vessel now belongs to me?”"
Chapter 33,"“Certainly, from the keel to the truck of the masts—all the wood, that"
Chapter 33,is.”
Chapter 33,"“Very well. Have the interior seats, bunks, and frames pulled down, and"
Chapter 33,burn them.”
Chapter 33,It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate
Chapter 33,"pressure, and on that day the poop, cabins, bunks, and the spare deck"
Chapter 33,"were sacrificed. On the next day, the 19th of December, the masts,"
Chapter 33,"rafts, and spars were burned; the crew worked lustily, keeping up the"
Chapter 33,"fires. Passepartout hewed, cut, and sawed away with all his might."
Chapter 33,There was a perfect rage for demolition.
Chapter 33,"The railings, fittings, the greater part of the deck, and top sides"
Chapter 33,"disappeared on the 20th, and the “Henrietta” was now only a flat hulk."
Chapter 33,But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light. By ten
Chapter 33,in the evening they were passing Queenstown. Phileas Fogg had only
Chapter 33,twenty-four hours more in which to get to London; that length of time
Chapter 33,"was necessary to reach Liverpool, with all steam on. And the steam was"
Chapter 33,about to give out altogether!
Chapter 33,"“Sir,” said Captain Speedy, who was now deeply interested in Mr. Fogg’s"
Chapter 33,"project, “I really commiserate you. Everything is against you. We are"
Chapter 33,only opposite Queenstown.”
Chapter 33,"“Ah,” said Mr. Fogg, “is that place where we see the lights"
Chapter 33,Queenstown?”
Chapter 33,“Yes.”
Chapter 33,“Can we enter the harbour?”
Chapter 33,“Not under three hours. Only at high tide.”
Chapter 33,"“Stay,” replied Mr. Fogg calmly, without betraying in his features that"
Chapter 33,by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer
Chapter 33,ill-fortune.
Chapter 33,Queenstown is the Irish port at which the transatlantic steamers stop
Chapter 33,to put off the mails. These mails are carried to Dublin by express
Chapter 33,trains always held in readiness to start; from Dublin they are sent on
Chapter 33,"to Liverpool by the most rapid boats, and thus gain twelve hours on the"
Chapter 33,Atlantic steamers.
Chapter 33,Phileas Fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way. Instead
Chapter 33,"of arriving at Liverpool the next evening by the “Henrietta,” he would"
Chapter 33,"be there by noon, and would therefore have time to reach London before"
Chapter 33,a quarter before nine in the evening.
Chapter 33,The “Henrietta” entered Queenstown Harbour at one o’clock in the
Chapter 33,"morning, it then being high tide; and Phileas Fogg, after being grasped"
Chapter 33,"heartily by the hand by Captain Speedy, left that gentleman on the"
Chapter 33,"levelled hulk of his craft, which was still worth half what he had sold"
Chapter 33,it for.
Chapter 33,The party went on shore at once. Fix was greatly tempted to arrest Mr.
Chapter 33,Fogg on the spot; but he did not. Why? What struggle was going on
Chapter 33,within him? Had he changed his mind about “his man”? Did he understand
Chapter 33,"that he had made a grave mistake? He did not, however, abandon Mr."
Chapter 33,"Fogg. They all got upon the train, which was just ready to start, at"
Chapter 33,half-past one; at dawn of day they were in Dublin; and they lost no
Chapter 33,"time in embarking on a steamer which, disdaining to rise upon the"
Chapter 33,"waves, invariably cut through them."
Chapter 33,"Phileas Fogg at last disembarked on the Liverpool quay, at twenty"
Chapter 33,"minutes before twelve, 21st December. He was only six hours distant"
Chapter 33,from London.
Chapter 33,"But at this moment Fix came up, put his hand upon Mr. Fogg’s shoulder,"
Chapter 33,"and, showing his warrant, said, “You are really Phileas Fogg?”"
Chapter 33,“I am.”
Chapter 33,“I arrest you in the Queen’s name!”
Chapter 34,CHAPTER XXXIV.
Chapter 34,IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AT LAST REACHES LONDON
Chapter 34,"Phileas Fogg was in prison. He had been shut up in the Custom House,"
Chapter 34,and he was to be transferred to London the next day.
Chapter 34,"Passepartout, when he saw his master arrested, would have fallen upon"
Chapter 34,Fix had he not been held back by some policemen. Aouda was
Chapter 34,thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not
Chapter 34,understand. Passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest
Chapter 34,and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber. The young woman’s heart
Chapter 34,"revolted against so heinous a charge, and when she saw that she could"
Chapter 34,"attempt to do nothing to save her protector, she wept bitterly."
Chapter 34,"As for Fix, he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty, whether"
Chapter 34,Mr. Fogg were guilty or not.
Chapter 34,"The thought then struck Passepartout, that he was the cause of this new"
Chapter 34,misfortune! Had he not concealed Fix’s errand from his master? When Fix
Chapter 34,"revealed his true character and purpose, why had he not told Mr. Fogg?"
Chapter 34,"If the latter had been warned, he would no doubt have given Fix proof"
Chapter 34,"of his innocence, and satisfied him of his mistake; at least, Fix would"
Chapter 34,not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his
Chapter 34,"master, only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil."
Chapter 34,"Passepartout wept till he was blind, and felt like blowing his brains"
Chapter 34,out.
Chapter 34,"Aouda and he had remained, despite the cold, under the portico of the"
Chapter 34,Custom House. Neither wished to leave the place; both were anxious to
Chapter 34,see Mr. Fogg again.
Chapter 34,"That gentleman was really ruined, and that at the moment when he was"
Chapter 34,about to attain his end. This arrest was fatal. Having arrived at
Chapter 34,"Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December, he"
Chapter 34,"had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club,"
Chapter 34,"that is, nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to London"
Chapter 34,was six hours.
Chapter 34,"If anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he would have"
Chapter 34,"found Mr. Fogg seated, motionless, calm, and without apparent anger,"
Chapter 34,"upon a wooden bench. He was not, it is true, resigned; but this last"
Chapter 34,blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion. Was
Chapter 34,"he being devoured by one of those secret rages, all the more terrible"
Chapter 34,"because contained, and which only burst forth, with an irresistible"
Chapter 34,"force, at the last moment? No one could tell. There he sat, calmly"
Chapter 34,"waiting—for what? Did he still cherish hope? Did he still believe, now"
Chapter 34,"that the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he would"
Chapter 34,succeed?
Chapter 34,"However that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the"
Chapter 34,"table, and observed its advancing hands. Not a word escaped his lips,"
Chapter 34,"but his look was singularly set and stern. The situation, in any event,"
Chapter 34,"was a terrible one, and might be thus stated: if Phileas Fogg was"
Chapter 34,"honest he was ruined; if he was a knave, he was caught."
Chapter 34,Did escape occur to him? Did he examine to see if there were any
Chapter 34,practicable outlet from his prison? Did he think of escaping from it?
Chapter 34,Possibly; for once he walked slowly around the room. But the door was
Chapter 34,"locked, and the window heavily barred with iron rods. He sat down"
Chapter 34,"again, and drew his journal from his pocket. On the line where these"
Chapter 34,"words were written, “21st December, Saturday, Liverpool,” he added,"
Chapter 34,"“80th day, 11.40 a.m.,” and waited."
Chapter 34,The Custom House clock struck one. Mr. Fogg observed that his watch was
Chapter 34,two hours too fast.
Chapter 34,Two hours! Admitting that he was at this moment taking an express
Chapter 34,"train, he could reach London and the Reform Club by a quarter before"
Chapter 34,"nine, p.m. His forehead slightly wrinkled."
Chapter 34,"At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside,"
Chapter 34,"then a hasty opening of doors. Passepartout’s voice was audible, and"
Chapter 34,immediately after that of Fix. Phileas Fogg’s eyes brightened for an
Chapter 34,instant.
Chapter 34,"The door swung open, and he saw Passepartout, Aouda, and Fix, who"
Chapter 34,hurried towards him.
Chapter 34,"Fix was out of breath, and his hair was in disorder. He could not"
Chapter 34,"speak. “Sir,” he stammered, “sir—forgive me—most—unfortunate"
Chapter 34,resemblance—robber arrested three days ago—you are free!”
Chapter 34,"Phileas Fogg was free! He walked to the detective, looked him steadily"
Chapter 34,"in the face, and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his"
Chapter 34,"life, or which he ever would make, drew back his arms, and with the"
Chapter 34,precision of a machine knocked Fix down.
Chapter 34,"“Well hit!” cried Passepartout, “Parbleu! that’s what you might call a"
Chapter 34,good application of English fists!”
Chapter 34,"Fix, who found himself on the floor, did not utter a word. He had only"
Chapter 34,"received his deserts. Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout left the Custom"
Chapter 34,"House without delay, got into a cab, and in a few moments descended at"
Chapter 34,the station.
Chapter 34,Phileas Fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave for
Chapter 34,London. It was forty minutes past two. The express train had left
Chapter 34,thirty-five minutes before. Phileas Fogg then ordered a special train.
Chapter 34,There were several rapid locomotives on hand; but the railway
Chapter 34,arrangements did not permit the special train to leave until three
Chapter 34,o’clock.
Chapter 34,"At that hour Phileas Fogg, having stimulated the engineer by the offer"
Chapter 34,"of a generous reward, at last set out towards London with Aouda and his"
Chapter 34,faithful servant.
Chapter 34,It was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half; and this
Chapter 34,would have been easy on a clear road throughout. But there were forced
Chapter 34,"delays, and when Mr. Fogg stepped from the train at the terminus, all"
Chapter 34,the clocks in London were striking ten minutes before nine.[1]
Chapter 34,"Having made the tour of the world, he was behind-hand five minutes. He"
Chapter 34,had lost the wager!
Chapter 34,[1] A somewhat remarkable eccentricity on the part of the London
Chapter 34,clocks!—TRANSLATOR.
Chapter 35,CHAPTER XXXV.
Chapter 35,IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG DOES NOT HAVE TO REPEAT HIS ORDERS TO
Chapter 35,PASSEPARTOUT TWICE
Chapter 35,"The dwellers in Saville Row would have been surprised the next day, if"
Chapter 35,they had been told that Phileas Fogg had returned home. His doors and
Chapter 35,"windows were still closed, no appearance of change was visible."
Chapter 35,"After leaving the station, Mr. Fogg gave Passepartout instructions to"
Chapter 35,"purchase some provisions, and quietly went to his domicile."
Chapter 35,He bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity. Ruined! And by
Chapter 35,the blundering of the detective! After having steadily traversed that
Chapter 35,"long journey, overcome a hundred obstacles, braved many dangers, and"
Chapter 35,"still found time to do some good on his way, to fail near the goal by a"
Chapter 35,"sudden event which he could not have foreseen, and against which he was"
Chapter 35,unarmed; it was terrible! But a few pounds were left of the large sum
